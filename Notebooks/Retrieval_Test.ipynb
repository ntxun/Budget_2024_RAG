       "'B. Are we doing enough to help Singaporeans cope with inflation?\\n5. First, on helping Singaporeans cope with inflation and cost pressures.  Several Members, including Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Henry Kwek, Ms Hazel Poa and many others, spoke about this.\\n6. Let us start by looking at the reasons for high inflation over the last two years.  These reasons are certainly not unique to Singapore. For more than a decade before Covid, global inflation was generally stable, hovering at around 4% per annum. Singapore enjoyed relatively stable inflation too, and in most years, it was lower than global inflation.\\n7. But in 2021, prices in global food, goods, and energy markets rose quickly, as strong demand came up against constrained supply due to pandemic-related restrictions.\\n8. Then the Russia-Ukraine war broke out in early 2022. The two countries are major suppliers of key commodities, like oil and gas, fertiliser, and wheat. This brought about a further surge in prices.  Many countries also saw a surge in demand for domestic services, and did not have sufficient workers to meet the demand.\\nPage 3 of 56\\n9. These are the key drivers of inflation everywhere. Singapore, like all other countries, felt the impact too.\\n10. Even so, inflation in Singapore did not reach the peaks seen in several parts of the world.\\n\\n10. Even so, inflation in Singapore did not reach the peaks seen in several parts of the world.\\n11. One reason was effective monetary policy. MAS tightened monetary policy five consecutive times starting in October 2021. This meant allowing the Singapore dollar to appreciate more quickly, which helped to shield us against the sharp spike in imported inflation. Had MAS not acted, core inflation for the whole of 2023 would have been 6.6%, instead of 4.2%.\\n12. Other major central banks acted too.\\n13. With the overall monetary tightening and the stabilisation of supply chains, significant headway has been made in bringing inflation down around the world.\\nPage 4 of 56 14. Overall inflation has come down, in line with the rest of the world. In Singapore, our headline inflation was already moderating since last\\nyear, and is expected to moderate further this year. We expect this trend to continue, similar to other advanced economies.\\nSource   epartment of Statistics  Singapore  and International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook  World .\\nNotes  Figures in chart refer to headline inflation in Singapore and the World, based on latest available data.\\n\\nB. Are we doing enough to help Singaporeans cope with inflation?\\n19. Sir, I have provided some key data points, so that we can understand the facts around the inflation situation globally and in Singapore.\\n20. In countries everywhere, including in Singapore, there tends to be a gap between economic data and perceptions. It is partly because it takes time for consumers to adjust to new economic realities.\\n21. Perceptions and sentiments are clearly important, and we take the feedback from the ground seriously, but we also need to examine the data closely to better shape policy responses.\\n22. It is in this broader context that the Government had extended support packages over the last two years to cushion the impact of inflation, particularly for lower- and middle-income Singaporeans.\\n23. This year, while inflation is moderating, we recognise that prices are still relatively high, and there are continued pressures for families and individuals.  That is why I have enhanced the Assurance Package in this Budget.\\n24. We have designed and sized the support of the enhancements carefully. There is something for everyone, regardless of age, property type, or income.\\n25. But we also do not want to inadvertently stimulate demand too much and push up prices, something which Ms Foo Mee Har cautioned against. So, the support is targeted and tilted towards those with less.'"
