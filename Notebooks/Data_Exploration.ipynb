I beg to move that Parliament approve the financial policy of \\nthe Government for the financial year 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025. \\n \\n2. Sir, the past year has not been easy.  \\n \\na. The international environment was troubled.  \\n \\nb. The global economy was subdued.  \\n \\nc. Our own economy grew by a modest 1.1%, avoiding a \\nrecession.  \\n \\n3. I know that many households are feeling the pressure of higher \\nliving costs. \\n \\na. Fortunately, we had some unexpected revenue upside \\nfrom our strong economic rebound in the preceding two \\nyears.\\n\\nPage 4 of 86 \\nb. And this is why the Government was able to enhance its \\nassistance measures to relieve the burden on households.  \\n \\n4. For 2024, the outlook is mixed.  \\n \\na. Growth in the major economies on the whole is expected \\nto remain resilient.  \\n \\nb. But geopolitical risks continue to loom large. \\n \\nc. Wars are raging in Europe and the Middle East. \\n \\nd. These conflicts can escalate dangerously, leading to \\ndisruptions in global energy markets and supply chains.  \\n \\n5. Fortunately, there are some upsides.  \\n \\na. Global inflationary pressures are expected to recede \\nfurther. This may provide room for the major central \\nbanks to adopt more accommodative stances, which can \\nhelp to ease financial conditions and support demand.\\n\\nPage 5 of 86 \\nb. The global electronics industry is expected to recover. This \\nwill bolster the growth of many regional economies, \\nincluding our key trading partners.  \\n \\nc. Meanwhile, Asia continues to be a key driver of global \\ngrowth, with a wider spread of opportunities across the \\nregion – not just in China, but also in India and many parts \\nof Southeast Asia.  \\n \\n6. Overall, we are cautiously optimistic that 2024 will be a better \\nyear. Besides lower inflation, we expect higher GDP growth at 1.0% to \\n3.0%.  \\n \\n7. But there is considerable uncertainty in the outlook and the \\nrisks are tilted to the downside. \\n \\na. The international environment has darkened dramatically.  \\n \\nb. The post-Cold War era that began in the early 90s and \\nfostered three decades of peace and stability is over.  \\n \\nc. We are now in a new era of conflict and confrontation, \\nand there is no turning back.\\n\\nPage 6 of 86 \\nd. What can we expect in this new world? \\n \\ne. It will be more violent. We already see a growing zone of \\nimpunity involving armed conflict and terrorism that \\ncannot be easily resolved by the global community.  \\n \\nf. It will be more fragmented. Because the major powers are \\nprioritising national security over economic \\ninterdependence, and the traditional modes of \\ncooperation are breaking down.  \\n \\ng. It will be messier and more unpredictable. Because there \\nwill be diminished willingness and capacity to tackle \\nglobal issues, be it responding to future pandemics or \\ntackling climate change.  \\n \\n8. These are the stark realities before us. For some time to come, \\nSingapore will have to operate in an external environment that will \\nbe less stable and favourable to our security and prosperity than the \\npreceding three decades.  \\n \\n9. That is why we embarked on the Forward Singapore exercise – \\nto refresh our social compact to keep our society strong and united,\\n\\nPage 7 of 86 \\nand to set out a roadmap for our way forward in this very troubled \\nworld.  \\n \\na. Through Forward Singapore, we aim to give more \\nassurance to help Singaporeans navigate the uncertainties \\nin today’s world; strengthen our sense of cohesion and \\nsolidarity; and keep our society together.  \\n \\nb. For as one united people, we can overcome all odds. \\n \\nc. We can turn every challenge into opportunity, and every \\nvulnerability into strength. \\n \\nd. We can build a nation that is vibrant and inclusive, fair and \\nthriving, resilient and united. \\n \\n10. We have an ambitious agenda to achieve these shared goals.  \\n \\na. We have major plans to unfold over the coming years. \\n \\nb. Some are ready to be implemented now.  \\n \\nc. Others will require more time to study or to work out the \\nimplementation details.\\n\\nPage 8 of 86 \\n \\nd. In this Budget, we will roll out the first instalment of our \\nForward Singapore programmes.  \\n \\n11. Budget 2024 is therefore about taking concrete steps to build \\nour shared future together. We will:  \\n \\na. Tackle immediate challenges for households and \\nbusinesses;  \\n \\nb. Pursue better jobs, better growth, and equip our workers \\nfor life; \\n \\nc. Create more paths for equality and mobility;  \\n \\nd. Provide more assurance for families and seniors;  \\n \\ne. And ultimately forge a stronger and more united nation.  \\n  \\n12. And I will touch on each of these in turn in the rest of my \\nspeech.\\n\\nPage 9 of 86 \\nB. Tackling Immediate Challenges \\n \\n13. Sir, we have enjoyed low inflation in Singapore for more than a \\ndecade. But inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of \\nthe war in Ukraine, which led to significant increases in global energy \\nand food prices.  \\n \\n14. Despite the unprecedented surge in prices, we had good \\neconomic growth in 2022. So incomes that year rose faster than \\ninflation and Singaporeans were better off, in real terms.  \\n \\n15. Unfortunately, this did not happen last year. Inflation had in fact \\nstarted to moderate. But economic growth also slowed. As a result, \\nreal incomes declined.  \\n \\n16. We had picked up early indicators of this negative trend. And \\nthat is why I introduced the Cost-of-Living Support Package in \\nSeptember last year, and enhanced the Assurance Package to over \\n$10 billion.  \\n \\n17. While we expect the situation to improve this year, there are \\nuncertainties in the outlook as I mentioned just now. So in this \\nBudget, I will do more to support households and further enhance \\nthe Assurance Package.\\n\\nPage 10 of 86 \\n \\na. First, I will provide an additional $600 in CDC Vouchers \\nfor all Singaporean households. The first $300 will be \\ndisbursed in end-June this year. The remaining $300 will \\nbe disbursed in January next year.  \\n \\nb. Second, I will provide a Cost-of-Living Special Payment of \\nbetween $200 and $400 in cash. This will be extended to \\nadult Singaporeans with Assessable Income of up to \\n$100,000, and who do not own more than one property.  \\n \\nc. Third, I will provide additional one-off U-Save rebates to \\nhelp households cope with increases in their utility bills. \\nIn total, eligible HDB households can expect to receive \\ntwo-and-a-half times the amount of regular U-Save \\nrebates, or up to $950, in FY2024. This will cover about \\nfour months of utility bills for those living in 3- and 4- \\nroom flats.  \\n \\nd. Fourth, I will provide an additional one-off Service and \\nConservancy Charges (or S&CC) Rebate for HDB flats. \\nTogether with the regular S&CC rebates, eligible HDB \\nhouseholds will receive up to four months of such rebates \\nin FY2024.\\n\\nPage 11 of 86 \\n \\ne. Altogether, the additional support under the Assurance \\nPackage will cost $1.9 billion. (See Annex B-1 for details of \\nthe enhanced Assurance Package.)  \\n \\n18. We have designed this Package so that lower-income families \\nget more support. We have also ensured that larger households, \\nparticularly those with seniors and children, get more support.  \\n \\n19. Let me give some illustrations:  \\n \\na. A lower-income household of four, with two young \\nchildren, will receive about $5,500 in benefits in FY2024. \\nThis comprises cash, MediSave top-ups, U-Save and S&CC \\nrebates, and CDC Vouchers.  \\n \\nb. A middle-income household of four, with two young \\nchildren, will receive about $3,000 in benefits. \\n \\nc. A middle-income household with six persons – a larger \\nfamily – including two seniors and two young children, will \\nreceive about $8,000 in benefits.\\n\\nPage 12 of 86 \\n20. Sir, these are concrete ways to help Singaporeans tackle cost-of-\\nliving pressures. Let me assure everyone: we will always have your \\nbacks. \\n \\n21. Beyond the Assurance Package, I will top up the GST Voucher \\nFund by $6 billion. This delivers on our commitment to permanently \\ndefray GST expenses for lower- and middle-income households, \\nthrough the GST Voucher scheme.  \\n \\n22. Businesses also need help to manage rising costs. Many \\ncompanies have seen increases in their wage bills, rental, and \\nutilities, amongst others. I will therefore introduce an Enterprise \\nSupport Package, which will provide $1.3 billion in support to \\ncompanies.  \\n \\na. First, companies will receive a 50% Corporate Income Tax \\nRebate, capped at $40,000, in the Year of Assessment \\n2024. Not all companies are profitable, and some may not \\nbenefit from such a rebate. So I will provide a minimum \\nbenefit of $2,000 in cash payouts for companies that \\nemployed at least one local employee in 2023.  \\n \\nb. Second, I will enhance the Enterprise Financing Scheme, \\nwhich helps Singapore enterprises with their financing\\n\\nPage 13 of 86 \\nneeds. The maximum working capital loan quantum will \\nbe permanently raised to $500,000. I will also extend until \\n31 March 2025 the enhanced maximum trade loan \\nquantum, as well as the Government’s risk sharing of \\nproject loans to support domestic construction projects. \\n \\nc. Third, I will extend the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit by a \\nyear to 30 June 2025. The Credit provides additional \\nsupport for eligible employers to cover their out-of-pocket \\nexpenses when they embark on workforce and business \\ntransformation. With this extension, employers will have \\nanother year to claim any unused credit.  \\n \\nd. The measures in this Enterprise Support Package are tilted \\ntowards firms that make the effort to restructure and \\ntransform. I encourage all firms to make full use of these \\nschemes, so that they can thrive and succeed, amidst a \\nmore challenging operating environment. (See Annex B-2 \\nfor details of Enterprise Support Package.) \\n \\n23. The enhanced Assurance Package and the Enterprise Support \\nPackage will provide some near-term relief to Singaporean \\nhouseholds and firms. These are needed during this period when \\ninflation, while moderating, remains on the high side. But they are\\n\\nPage 14 of 86 \\nnot permanent solutions. In the longer term, the best way to deal \\nwith inflation is to ensure that our firms and workers are more \\nproductive, and that real incomes continue to rise sustainably.\\n\\nPage 15 of 86 \\nC. Pursuing Better Growth and Jobs \\n \\n24. Our key priority therefore is to ensure a strong, innovative, and \\nvibrant economy. This is absolutely essential to secure good jobs and \\nbetter lives for all Singaporeans, and on a sustained basis.  \\n \\n25. Since our early days of independence, we have been able to \\ndefy the odds and consistently achieve good economic performance. \\nBut we cannot afford to be complacent, especially in a more complex \\nand volatile external environment.  \\n \\n26. In past years, some had suggested that Singapore should slow \\ndown; don’t have to grow so quickly. Indeed, this was what \\nhappened last year – our economy grew by just about 1%. But if we \\nwere to experience similarly slow growth for several years in a row, \\nwe will be in trouble. We will have no chance of improving our \\ncollective well-being. Singaporeans’ living standards will be dented. \\nWe will not be able to afford the social services we need. And in the \\nend, lower-income workers and families will be hit the hardest.  \\n \\n27. We therefore make no apology for pursuing growth. To be clear, \\nwe are not going for growth at all costs. There is a limit to how fast \\nwe can grow due to the tighter constraints we face in land, labour, \\nand carbon. But by focusing on productivity and innovation, we can\\n\\nPage 16 of 86 \\npush the frontier and grow at an average of about 2% to 3% each \\nyear over the next decade. \\n \\n28. Now, this is an ambitious goal given our stage of economic \\ndevelopment. But we must aim high, so that Singapore keeps moving \\nforward, and our people continue to enjoy more opportunities and a \\nbetter quality of life. \\n \\nAnchoring Quality Investments \\n \\n29. A crucial enabler for growth is our ability to attract high-quality \\nand high-value investments to Singapore, because such projects bring \\nthe latest know-how and capabilities, and create good jobs for \\nSingaporeans.  \\n \\n30. So far, our investment pipeline has been healthy. Despite a \\nchallenging external environment last year, EDB exceeded its targets, \\nand brought in investments which are expected to create over 20,000 \\nnew jobs. \\n \\n31. But the competition for investments is getting tougher. \\n \\na. Governments around the world are rolling out vast \\nsubsidies to attract investments, especially in strategic\\n\\nPage 17 of 86 \\nindustries. For example, in November last year, Japan \\nannounced that it would allocate 2 trillion yen, or about \\n$18 billion, to support its semiconductor industry.  \\n \\nb. We cannot afford to engage in a “bidding war” with the \\nmajor economies.  \\n \\nc. But neither should we stand still and just do nothing. \\n \\n32. We will therefore enhance our investment promotion toolkit by \\nintroducing a new Refundable Investment Credit. (See Annex C-1.)  \\n \\na. This is a tax credit with a refundable cash feature. It will \\nsupport high-value and substantive economic activities, \\nincluding the setting up or expansion of manufacturing \\nfacilities; new innovation and R&D activities; as well as \\nactivities in support of the green transition.  \\n \\nb. Essentially, this new tax credit will help us stay \\ncompetitive and attract investments from global \\ncompanies with the right know-how, and create good jobs \\nfor Singaporeans.\\n\\nPage 18 of 86 \\n33. To support this and other investment promotion efforts, I will \\ntop up the National Productivity Fund by $2 billion.  \\n \\nBuilding on Our Strengths \\n \\n34. Besides anchoring new investments, we must build on our \\nexisting strengths, and upgrade the sectors where we have \\ncompetitive advantages.  \\n \\n35. These advantages did not come about by chance. They are the \\nresult of many decades of hard work to restructure and to upgrade \\nour economy. We did not just keep costs competitive. We also \\nenhanced our capabilities and moved up the value chain, so as to \\njustify the higher premiums for operating out of Singapore. And we \\nare pressing on with these restructuring efforts through the Industry \\nTransformation Maps.  \\n \\n36. Take semiconductors as one example. Singapore is not the \\ncheapest location worldwide. But we have many things going for us – \\nour excellent connectivity, our reliability and stable business \\nenvironment, and also a critical mass of leading companies based \\nhere. And they operate across the value chain, from design, to wafer \\nfabrication, to assembly and testing. The companies here do not \\nproduce cutting-edge 3 nm chips, which you will read about in the\\n\\nPage 19 of 86 \\nmedia these days. But they have carved out a niche in other types of \\nchips, like specialty chips and NAND flash memory chips. These are \\ncritical enablers of automation, 5G, electric vehicles, and they are in \\nhigh demand. And that is how this little red dot can be a key node in \\nthe semiconductor supply chain – we account on our own for more \\nthan 10% of the global semiconductor market, and 20% of \\nsemiconductor equipment in the world.  \\n \\n37. Likewise in finance, we are a leading centre in Asia, supporting \\nbusinesses from all over the world. During this period of global \\nuncertainty, we have been able to distinguish ourselves as a stable \\nand trusted financial centre. The major financial institutions are keen \\nto do more out of Singapore, and we are seeing a continued inflow of \\ninvestments, capital, and talent.  \\n \\n38. So whether in advanced manufacturing or high-end services, \\nthe strengths we have today are not easily replicated by others. But \\nthe global competitive landscape is ever-changing and other \\ncountries, you can be sure, are seeking to overtake us. So in this \\nBudget, I will set aside resources to reinforce our competitive lead. \\n \\n39. I will top up the Financial Sector Development Fund by $2 \\nbillion. This will give MAS more resources to take full advantage of \\ncurrent opportunities, and extend our lead in the financial services\\n\\nPage 20 of 86 \\nsector – not just to do more in the core areas of banking, capital \\nmarkets, asset management, and insurance, but also to build \\ncapabilities in new areas like FinTech, as well as green and transition \\nfinance.  \\n \\n40. I will set aside more funds for R&D – Research and \\nDevelopment – because this is how we push the frontiers of \\ninnovation across the entire economy.  \\n \\na. In 2020, we launched the Research, Innovation and \\nEnterprise 2025 (or RIE2025) plan, with a commitment of \\n$25 billion.  \\n \\nb. I will invest a further $3 billion in RIE2025.  \\n \\nc. This will sustain our investments in research, innovation, \\nand enterprise at about 1% of GDP . The additional \\nresources will go towards research and related \\ninvestments in national priorities such as advanced \\nmanufacturing, sustainability, the digital economy, and \\nhealthcare.  \\n \\nd. Our investments in R&D will take some time to translate \\ninto concrete outcomes. But we must take a long-term\\n\\nPage 21 of 86 \\nview. For these investments help to develop a critical mass \\nof capabilities, ideas, and talent. They enable us to \\nsharpen our competitive edge globally, as a knowledge-\\nbased and innovation-driven economy.  \\n \\n41. Besides a steady commitment to R&D, we also need to harness \\nthe full power of technology across our key sectors.  \\n \\n42. One critical emerging technology is Artificial Intelligence. AI is \\nnot just about ChatGPT or Large Language Models. It is a general-\\npurpose technology, like electricity, the internal combustion engine, \\nthe computer, or the internet. It has the potential to transform a \\nwide range of industries, and to enhance productivity across many \\nexisting processes, from drug discovery, to organising warehouses, or \\ndriving vehicles.  \\n \\n43. Singapore is already recognised as a serious player in AI \\ndevelopment. We aim to go further – to build new peaks of \\nexcellence, and crowd in private sector investments. We have set out \\nthe plans to do so in the National AI Strategy 2.0. \\n \\n44.  To support this strategy and further catalyse AI activities, I will \\ninvest more than $1 billion over the next five years into AI compute, \\ntalent, and industry development.\\n\\nPage 22 of 86 \\n \\na. Part of the investment will be used to ensure that \\nSingapore can secure access to the advanced chips that \\nare so crucial to AI development and deployment.  \\n \\nb. We will also work with leading companies in Singapore \\nand around the world to set up their AI Centres of \\nExcellence here. We want these Centres to spur industry \\ncollaboration and innovation, and drive greater value \\ncreation across the whole economy.  \\n \\n45. In tandem, I will allocate additional resources to catalyse \\ninvestments in upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network. \\nWith the additional investments, we aim to enable mass market \\naccess to broadband speeds of up to 10 Gigabits per second in the \\nsecond half of this decade. This is 10 times faster than the broadband \\nspeed in most homes today. This also ensures that our connectivity \\ninfrastructure will be able to support technologies like AI and \\nimmersive media, as they become more pervasive in the future.  \\n \\nDeveloping Our Local Enterprises \\n \\n46. We will continue to do more to invest in and strengthen our \\nlocal enterprises.\\n\\nPage 23 of 86 \\n \\na. We are helping smaller firms harness technology through \\npre-approved solutions, many tailored to the needs of \\nspecific industries. This enables the SMEs to “plug and \\nplay” and quickly achieve greater efficiencies and \\nproductivity gains.  \\n \\nb. As companies grow, their needs will become more \\ncomplex, especially as they go overseas. We are providing \\nmore customised support to help these companies scale \\nup, and we will continue with these efforts.  \\n \\n47. One way for our companies to level up quickly is to partner with \\nthe multinational enterprises (or the MNEs) that are based here. The \\nMNEs set high requirements and standards for firms that wish to \\npartner or supply to them. We cannot force MNEs to choose only \\nlocal suppliers. But we can and we will help Singapore enterprises to \\nmeet the high standards, and to form win-win partnerships with \\nMNEs.  \\n \\na. Let me share an example from the aerospace industry. \\nAerospace parts must meet stringent manufacturing and \\nsafety requirements. So aerospace manufacturers like\\n\\nPage 24 of 86 \\nRolls-Royce are highly selective in who they choose as \\npartners.  \\n \\nb. Zincode, a local company, was supported by the Smart \\nManufacturing Joint Lab. This is a collaboration between \\nA*STAR, Rolls-Royce, and Singapore Aero Engine Services \\nPrivate Limited. The company was supported by the Lab \\nto improve its image processing capabilities. As a result, it \\nqualified as one of the approved partners for inspection \\nwork at the Rolls-Royce manufacturing facility here in \\nSingapore. Zincode has now successfully captured new \\nopportunities from other companies in the aerospace \\nsector, and benefited from an increase in sales.  \\n \\n48. We want to help more companies like Zincode raise their \\ncapabilities and win new opportunities. Today, we have the \\nPartnerships for Capability Transformation (or PACT) scheme. This \\nsupports collaborations between larger companies and SMEs, in the \\nareas of supplier development and co-innovation.  \\n \\na. I will enhance PACT to support partnerships in more areas \\n– including capability training, internationalisation, and \\ncorporate venturing.\\n\\nPage 25 of 86 \\nb. With the enhanced PACT, we aim to help more of our local \\nfirms plug into global supply chains, compete in markets \\nabroad, and grow to become industry leaders in their own \\nright.  \\n \\n49. For firms to be competitive, they also need to embrace \\nsustainability. SMEs today sometimes still treat sustainability as an \\nadditional imposition and cost. But going green can be a competitive \\nadvantage. Because the MNEs are already looking to reduce their \\ncarbon footprint, and they expect their suppliers to do the same. In \\nother words, to play in the MNE value chain, our own companies \\nmust be “sustainability-ready”.  \\n \\n50. I will therefore extend the enhanced support for green loans \\nunder the Enterprise Financing Scheme, and expand its scope to \\nhelp more of our SMEs adopt green solutions.  \\n \\n51. I will also enhance the Energy Efficiency Grant. This was \\nintroduced in 2022 for companies in the Food Services, Food \\nManufacturing, and Retail sectors. I will extend the grant to more \\nsectors including Manufacturing, Construction, Maritime, and Data \\nCentres and their users. Beyond pre-approved energy-efficient \\nsolutions supported under the Grant, we will provide additional\\n\\nPage 26 of 86 \\nsupport for companies with more ambitious plans to reduce their \\nemissions. (See Annex C-2.)  \\n \\n52. The Minister for Trade and Industry will elaborate on this and \\nother sustainability-related measures at the Committee of Supply.  \\n \\n53. We are taking concrete steps to keep our economy competitive \\nand vibrant, and to help our enterprises seize new opportunities. We \\nwill do whatever it takes to secure our place as one of the leading \\neconomic hubs in the world, known for our innovation, dynamism, \\nand deep capabilities, with good jobs and opportunities for our \\npeople.\\n\\nPage 27 of 86 \\nD. Equipping Our Workers for Life \\n \\n54. Sir, people and talent are critical to our economic dynamism. \\nWe are investing heavily in our human capital, including in preschool \\nand education. But learning cannot stop when formal schooling ends, \\nand that is why we launched SkillsFuture – to systematically support \\nSingaporeans in reskilling and upskilling, and to equip them \\nthroughout life.  \\n \\n55. The Singapore workforce today ranks highly in terms of skills \\nand technical proficiency. Our workers are able to command a \\npremium in the global marketplace because of their expertise. But \\nwith rapid technological advances, expertise is in constant flux. Jobs \\nlike data entry clerks and door-to-door salesmen have dwindled in \\nnumbers. New jobs that did not exist decades ago, like data scientists \\nand digital marketers are now in demand.  \\n \\n56. Expertise keeps on changing. In other words, robots and \\nmachines will not completely replace humans at work. But they do \\nchange the way expertise is defined and how value is created. We \\ntherefore have to invest even more in our human capital, and help \\nour workers refresh and update their skills, and learn how to harness \\nnew technologies more effectively. Indeed, this is something that\\n\\nPage 28 of 86 \\nNTUC and the Labour Movement have consistently championed, \\nmost recently in the Forward Singapore engagements.  \\n \\nStrengthening SkillsFuture \\n \\n57. We started SkillsFuture nearly 10 years ago. Since then, \\nGovernment spending on Continuing Education and Training has \\nnearly doubled to $0.9 billion last year.  \\n \\n58. Today, every Singaporean gets a $500 SkillsFuture Credit, and all \\nemployers get support to train their workers. We have also built up a \\nwide array of training options, which individuals enjoy generous \\nsubsidies for.  \\n \\n59. We have made good progress over the past decade. But there is \\nstill much more to be done. Continuous skills upgrading throughout \\nlife is now more than important than ever. So we must firmly \\nestablish SkillsFuture as a key pillar in our social compact. \\n  \\n60. Quality learning and skills training is not just about attending a \\none- or two-day course. Workers may need weeks or even months of \\ntraining to get a proper skills reboot, especially if they are looking to \\nmove to a different area of work. Even if they stay in the same\\n\\nPage 29 of 86 \\nindustry, they will need a substantial injection of skills from time to \\ntime to stay relevant.  \\n \\n61. But we know that taking time off from work to attend training \\ncourses over an extended period is not easy, especially for those in \\ntheir 40s and 50s with financial and caregiving obligations. \\n \\n62. I will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Level-Up \\nProgramme to better support our mid-career workers. I will share the \\nbroad thrusts of this programme, and the Minister for Education will \\nprovide more details at the Committee of Supply. (See Annex D-1.)  \\n \\n63. First, I will give all Singaporeans aged 40 and above a top-up in \\nSkillsFuture Credit of $4,000.  \\n \\na. All Singaporeans aged 40 and above will get the top-up in \\nMay this year. For those who are younger, you do not have \\nto worry. Your turn will come – you will get the top-up, \\nwhen you turn 40.  \\n \\nb. We have deliberately allowed the existing basic tier of \\n$500 in SkillsFuture Credit to be used for a wide range of \\ncourses, and this was to instil a habit of lifelong learning.\\n\\nPage 30 of 86 \\nc. The new credit – this $4,000 credit – will be more targeted \\nin scope. We will confine its usage to selected training \\nprogrammes with better employability outcomes. This \\nincludes part-time and full-time diploma, post-diploma, \\nundergraduate programmes, as well as courses for the \\nProgressive Wage Model sectors. And that is because we \\nwant participants taking up these programmes to be \\nassured of better employment outcomes after they have \\ncompleted their training.  \\n \\n64. Second, to provide more reskilling options, I will provide \\nsubsidies to all Singaporeans aged 40 and above to pursue another \\nfull-time diploma at our Polytechnics, ITE, and Arts Institutions from \\nAcademic Year 2025 onwards.  \\n \\n65. In other words, we will give every Singaporean another bite of \\nthe education subsidy. Even after you have graduated from an \\nInstitute of Higher Learning as a younger person, you can come back \\nagain after you turn 40 to do a full-time diploma, and it will be at \\nsubsidised rates.  \\n \\n66. Third, I will provide a monthly training allowance to \\nSingaporeans aged 40 and above who enrol in selected full-time \\ncourses.\\n\\nPage 31 of 86 \\n \\na. This training allowance will be equivalent to 50% of one’s \\naverage income over the latest available 12-month period, \\nand will be capped at $3,000 per month. Every individual \\ncan receive up to 24 months of such a training allowance \\nthroughout their lifetime.  \\n \\nb. This will support the full duration of a SkillsFuture Career \\nTransition Programme, and more than half the duration of \\nmost qualifications issued by our Institutes of Higher \\nLearning.  \\n \\n67. What do these changes mean for our workers?  \\n \\na. Take the example of Mr Calvin Li, 40 years old now; \\ngraduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in \\nElectronic, Computer and Communication Engineering.  \\n \\nb. He works today as a Project Director at Khoon \\nEngineering, a mechanical and electrical service provider. \\nWith the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, he will enjoy a \\n$4,000 top-up in SkillsFuture Credit.\\n\\nPage 32 of 86 \\nc. He can use the Credit to pursue a second diploma. This \\ndiploma will be offered at subsidised fees, and the Credit \\nwill cover more than half of the expense after subsidies. \\n \\nd. Should he intend to do this full-time, he can receive the \\nmonthly training allowance of up to 50% of his previous \\npay for two years.  \\n \\n68. Sir, we are making a significant enhancement to our SkillsFuture \\necosystem. But we will reap the full benefits only if all of us – \\ngovernment, employers, workers, and unions – lean forward to truly \\ndeepen this culture of lifelong learning and skills mastery. This must \\nbe our shared commitment to one another – to help our fellow \\nSingaporeans develop to their fullest potential, and to have \\nproductive and meaningful careers. \\n \\nSupporting the Involuntarily Unemployed  \\n \\n69. There is one other move we will make under SkillsFuture. We \\nknow that technological changes will bring about more churn in the \\neconomy. Even when the economy as a whole is doing well, some \\nbusinesses or even some industries may be suffering. In fact, it is not \\npossible to have an economy that is dynamic and growing without\\n\\nPage 33 of 86 \\nfailures and losses. In some sectors, firms will have to let go of \\npeople, while in other sectors, new and better jobs will be created. \\n  \\n70. We have to accept this reality. But it doesn’t mean we should \\nbe indifferent to the suffering caused when firms lay off their \\nworkers. \\n \\n71. Losing a job is a major setback for workers and their families. \\nThose who become involuntarily unemployed naturally feel the \\npressure to rush into the first available job they find. But the new job \\nmay not always be a good fit. Ideally, they should consider ways to \\nupgrade their skills, and to find a job that fits their aptitude and \\ntalent. Displaced workers may not have the time to train or search for \\nnew jobs, especially when they are already straining to make ends \\nmeet. \\n \\n72. Therefore, we will do more to support this group of workers. In \\nparticular, we will introduce a temporary financial support scheme \\nfor the involuntarily unemployed, while they undergo training or look \\nfor better-fitting jobs.  \\n \\na. We have to design this scheme carefully, including the \\nquantum of support and the conditionalities that come \\nwith the support. This is to avoid the pitfalls that other\\n\\nPage 34 of 86 \\ncountries experienced when they introduced \\nunemployment benefits.  \\n \\nb. We are working out the parameters for the scheme, and \\nwe will provide more details later this year. \\n \\n73. Ours must always be an economy that provides opportunities \\nfor all; an economy that benefits the many rather than the few. This \\nis why we are making significant enhancements to SkillsFuture, and \\nsupporting jobseekers while they search for their next opportunity. \\nWe believe that every worker matters; that every citizen counts. We \\nwill equip every Singaporean to benefit from the fruits of our \\neconomic growth.\\n\\nPage 35 of 86 \\nE. Creating More Paths Towards Equality and Mobility  \\n \\n74. In many developed countries, rising inequality and slowing \\nmobility have fractured cohesion, and deeply divided their peoples. \\nThese can create similar pressures here.  \\n \\n75. Indeed, we embarked on the Forward Singapore exercise \\nbecause we do not want to succumb to the kind of harsh inequality \\nwe see in so many parts of the world. By creating more paths \\ntowards equality and mobility, we also put ourselves in a better \\nposition for continued growth – in other words, a strong economy \\nand a strong society reinforce each other.  \\n \\n76. But tackling inequality is often easier said than done. Ideas on \\nhow to do so are frequently replete with unintended consequences. \\nSimple handouts and blunt measures do not solve poverty. This is \\nwhy Singapore has continually paved our own way since the \\nbeginning. We carefully study the experiences of others. We take \\nnote of where they have succeeded and failed. We introduce \\nsignificant innovations that work for us, our ethos, our society. This is \\nthe Singapore way.  \\n \\nReducing Wage Gaps\\n\\nPage 36 of 86 \\n77. Over the last decade, we have made progress in uplifting lower-\\nwage workers, and reducing disparities in wages. Our income \\ninequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, has declined to its \\nlowest level over two decades.  \\n \\n78. Workfare and Progressive Wages are our key strategies to uplift \\nour lower-wage workers. These strategies are working. I will make \\nseveral adjustments to ensure they continue to deliver results. (See \\nAnnex E-1.) \\n \\n79. First, I will enhance the Workfare Income Supplement scheme \\nfrom next year.  \\n \\na. I will raise the qualifying income cap from $2,500 to \\n$3,000. This ensures that we continue to cover lower-\\nwage workers, even as their wages grow.  \\n \\nb. I will also raise Workfare payouts. Lower-wage senior \\nworkers will qualify for a maximum annual payout of \\n$4,900, from $4,200 today.  \\n \\n80. Second, I will raise the Local Qualifying Salary (or the LQS). All \\nlocal employees at companies that hire foreign workers must be paid \\nat least the LQS.\\n\\nPage 37 of 86 \\n \\na. The LQS for full-time workers will be raised from $1,400 \\nto $1,600 from this year. The minimum hourly rate will be \\nincreased from $9 to $10.50 per hour. \\n \\nb. This increase ensures we keep pace with wage growth.  \\n \\n81.  Third, I will provide more support for employers who raise the \\nwages of their lower-wage workers.  \\n \\na. In 2022, I introduced the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme \\n(or the PWCS), where the Government co-funds the wage \\nincrease of lower-wage workers with employers.  \\n \\nb. I know employers are concerned with rising business costs \\nin today’s economy. And so the Government will do its \\npart to help. I will raise the co-funding levels for this year, \\nfrom a maximum of 30%, to a maximum of 50%. \\n \\nc. I will also raise the PWCS wage ceiling from $2,500 to \\n$3,000 in 2025, in tandem with the increase in the \\nqualifying income cap for Workfare.\\n\\nPage 38 of 86 \\nd. And to provide for these enhancements, I will top up the \\nPWCS Fund by $1 billion.  \\n \\n82. Besides uplifting lower-wage workers, we also want to improve \\nwages across different professions. There will always be differences in \\nwages in any society. But too large a gap creates unhealthy levels of \\nanxiety and stress. Parents and children may get caught up in an \\neducation arms race, or may feel pressured to prioritise careers only \\nin a few traditional fields, instead of focusing on their individual \\nstrengths and talents.  \\n \\n83. In fact, the vast majority of Singaporeans in the Forward \\nSingapore engagements welcome broader definitions of success. We \\nwant more diverse pathways so that every individual can strive to be \\nthe best possible version of themselves. This also means we must \\naccord greater value to those who are skilled in technical hands-on \\nabilities, as well as those with the social and empathetic traits to \\nexcel in service jobs. In particular, the wages and career prospects of \\nour ITE graduates should not be too far below their Polytechnic- and \\nUniversity-going peers.  \\n \\n84. I recently met some recent ITE graduates. I was inspired by their \\npersonal stories, and their enthusiasm to deepen the skills they have \\nacquired at ITE.\\n\\nPage 39 of 86 \\n \\n85. One of them, Matthew Francis Thanarajoo, graduated from ITE \\nin 2021 with a Higher Nitec in Mechatronics.  \\n \\na. He is now pursuing a Diploma in Mechatronics at Temasek \\nPolytechnic, and honing his skills in automation and \\nrobotics.  \\n \\nb. These experiences have equipped him with confidence to \\npursue his aspirations in engineering. He will be \\nrepresenting Singapore at the WorldSkills competition \\nlater this year in France, and we wish him the very best.  \\n  \\n86. We want to encourage and support more young ITE graduates \\nin their upskilling efforts, so they can excel in a profession they have \\ntrained in, and get themselves onto a better career and wage \\ntrajectory. I will therefore provide more support for ITE graduates \\naged 30 and below through a new ITE Progression Award.  \\n \\n87. There are two parts to the Award:  \\n \\na. First, I will provide a $5,000 top-up to the Post-Secondary \\nEducation Accounts of ITE graduates when they enrol in a\\n\\nPage 40 of 86 \\ndiploma programme. This will help to offset the costs of \\nobtaining a diploma. \\n \\nb. Second, when these students attain their diplomas, I will \\nprovide a further $10,000 top-up to their CPF Ordinary \\nAccounts. This will give them a head-start in purchasing a \\nhome or saving for retirement.  \\n \\nc. Sir, this new Award is a significant investment in our ITE \\ngraduates. It represents our continuing commitment to \\nuplift them, and to better equip them in their journey of \\nlifelong learning.  \\n \\nAdvancing Social Mobility  \\n \\n88. Besides tackling inequality, we must also uphold social mobility. \\nAnd up to now, Singapore has fared better than other advanced \\neconomies. But we must continue to pay special attention to children \\nfrom less well-off families, to ensure they have access to full and fair \\nopportunities early in life.  \\n \\n89. Many of these families are already taking steps to build better \\nlives for themselves, but they may find it hard to sustain progress.\\n\\nPage 41 of 86 \\nWe know that they often face complex challenges, such as marital \\nstress, existing debts, or even motivation or self-confidence issues.  \\n \\n90. Under the enhanced ComLink (or ComLink+), we are providing \\nmore customised support for these families. We are getting family \\ncoaches and volunteer befrienders to work directly with these \\nfamilies. They will jointly develop action plans to improve their life \\ncircumstances, and the coaches will provide additional support to the \\nfamilies, so as to encourage and motivate them towards their goals.  \\n \\na. The additional support will be rolled out in the form of \\nComLink+ Progress Packages. And this is yet another \\nmajor innovation in our social policy landscape. (See \\nAnnex E-2.) \\n \\nb. For example, adults in the family can each receive payouts \\nof up to $600 every quarter, through a combination of \\ncash and CPF, if they secure a job and stay employed.  \\n \\nc. Those who make voluntary contributions to their CPF will \\nreceive matching grants from the Government to grow \\ntheir savings faster. This, combined with existing schemes \\nlike the Fresh Start Housing Scheme, will help these \\nfamilies buy their own homes.\\n\\nPage 42 of 86 \\n \\nd. We will also partner with corporates and community \\ngroups to implement the ComLink+ Progress Packages. \\nThe donors can provide additional financial support to \\nthese families, and contribute in other ways, like \\nbefriending and mentoring, to help them get back on their \\nfeet again.  \\n  \\n91. Sir, in this Budget, we are taking further steps to ensure that all \\nSingaporeans have opportunities to take on work they find \\nmeaningful and fulfilling, build on their talents, give their best, and \\nbe rewarded fairly for it. This is how we keep the Singapore Dream \\nalive and well for all our people.  \\n \\n92. The Government will do our part. But I want to emphasise that \\nit is not just about the Government doing more. We also need our \\nemployers, community groups, as well as families and individuals \\nthemselves, to step up. Together, we can and we will build – a fairer, \\na more equal, and a more inclusive Singapore.\\n\\nPage 43 of 86 \\nF. Providing More Assurance for Families and Seniors  \\n \\n93. Next, let me touch on our plans to build a Singapore made for \\nfamilies – an endearing home for all of us to sink roots, grow up, and \\ngrow old in.  \\n \\nSupporting Families through Every Stage \\n \\n94. Families are the bedrock of our society, and we will support \\ntheir needs at every stage of life. \\n \\n95. Let me start with support for our children, to give them a strong \\nfoundation in life.  \\n \\n96. We will continue to take steps to improve preschool \\naffordability.  \\n \\na. At Government-supported preschools, we extend \\ngenerous subsidies, so that out-of-pocket expenses are \\nkept affordable.  \\n \\nb. We will lower the fees further so that full-day preschool \\nexpenses for dual-income families will be comparable to\\n\\nPage 44 of 86 \\nthose of primary school and after-school student care.  \\n \\nc. We will do so in two stages. I will reduce monthly \\nchildcare fee caps in Government-supported preschools \\nin 2025, to $640 for Anchor Operators and $680 for \\nPartner Operators. This is before the childcare subsidies \\nwhich all families benefit from. I will make another move \\nto reduce fee caps in 2026, and the details will be \\nannounced later.  \\n \\nd. I will also enhance existing preschool subsidies for lower-\\nincome families. Currently, more subsidies are given to \\nchildren with working mothers. I will extend these higher \\nsubsidies to all children from lower-income families, \\nincluding those with non-working mothers. This will \\nbenefit up to 17,000 children.  \\n \\n97. In schools, we will do more to help our children develop the \\ncompetencies and values they need to thrive in a more unpredictable \\nfuture.  \\n \\na. MOE is placing more emphasis on competencies like \\nadaptive and inventive thinking, communication skills, and \\ncivic literacy.\\n\\nPage 45 of 86 \\n \\nb. We want to encourage and recognise students who \\ndemonstrate such competencies, including by enhancing \\nthe Edusave awards.  \\n \\nc. I will therefore top up the Edusave Endowment Fund by \\n$2 billion to support these and other education initiatives.  \\n \\n98.  For young couples who are getting ready to settle down and \\nform their own families, timely access to affordable housing is critical.  \\n \\na. We are helping first-timer families by ramping up BTO \\nsupply and giving them greater priority.  \\n \\nb. We are also making flats in choicer locations more \\naffordable, and in a way that is fair and inclusive, through \\nthe “Prime, Plus, and Standard” framework. This will be \\nimplemented later this year for new BTO projects. \\n \\n99. Some couples have already booked their BTO flats, but they \\nmay like to have a place to stay temporarily, while they wait for the \\ncompletion of their flats. And this is especially the case for those with \\nyoung children.\\n\\nPage 46 of 86 \\na. Currently, HDB offers subsidised rental housing under the \\nParenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (or the PPHS). \\n \\nb. HDB receives many such applications for the scheme, and \\nis ramping up supply to meet the demand. But in the \\ninterim, we want to do more to support such young \\nfamilies with urgent housing needs.  \\n \\nc. I will therefore provide a PPHS (Open Market) Voucher \\nfor one year, to support eligible families who rent a HDB \\nflat in the open market.  \\n \\n100. In this Budget, I will also do more for families of persons with \\nspecial needs or disabilities. \\n \\na. We know that families of children with special needs face \\ngreater cost pressures due to higher fees at education and \\ncare services. Every student at a Special Education (or \\nSPED) school already benefits from more subsidies than a \\nprimary school student in a mainstream school. But the \\nfees at most SPED schools remain higher than those of \\nmainstream schools due to the higher underlying costs.\\n\\nPage 47 of 86 \\nb. We are studying further moves to alleviate the cost \\npressures on these families. As a first step, I will reduce \\nthe maximum monthly fees at SPED schools to $90, \\ndown from $150 today. I will also lower the fee caps at all \\nSpecial Student Care Centres to reduce the out-of-pocket \\nexpenses for families. \\n \\nc. For adults with disabilities, I will provide more support \\nfor their employment and integration into the \\ncommunity. I will expand spaces in Sheltered Workshops \\nand Day Activity Centres where they can undergo skills \\ntraining, and launch more Enabling Services Hubs to \\nprovide community support to persons with disabilities \\nand their caregivers.  \\n \\n101. The respective Ministers will share more on each of these \\nmoves at the Committee of Supply.  \\n \\nStrengthening Retirement Adequacy  \\n \\n102. I will do more to support the retirement needs of our seniors.  \\n \\n103. And let me start with some adjustments to the CPF system. \\n(See Annex F-1.)\\n\\nPage 48 of 86 \\n \\n104. First, in line with the recommendations of the Tripartite \\nWorkgroup on Older Workers, we will continue with the next step of \\nplanned CPF contribution rate increases for senior workers. I will \\nincrease the CPF contribution rates for those aged 55 to 65 by a \\nfurther 1.5 percentage points in 2025.  \\n \\n105. I will also provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for \\nanother year, to cover half of the increase in employer contributions \\nfor 2025. This will help to cushion the impact on business costs.  \\n \\n106. Second, I will raise the Enhanced Retirement Sum. \\n \\na. The ERS is the maximum amount that members can put \\ninto their CPF Retirement Accounts to receive CPF \\npayouts. \\n \\nb. I will increase the ERS from three times the Basic \\nRetirement Sum, to four times, from 2025. This means the \\nERS next year will be $426,000. This will allow more \\nmembers aged 55 and above to fully commit their \\naccumulated CPF savings to receive higher CPF payouts, \\nshould they wish to do so.\\n\\nPage 49 of 86 \\n107. Third, we will take steps to rationalise the CPF system.  \\n \\na. Today, members aged 55 and above have a Special \\nAccount and a Retirement Account.  \\n \\nb. From next year, we will close the SA – the Special Account \\n– for those aged 55 and above. The SA savings will be \\ntransferred to the RA – the Retirement Account – up to \\nthe Full Retirement Sum, where they will continue to earn \\nthe long-term interest rate.  \\n \\nc. The remaining SA savings will be transferred to the \\nOrdinary Account. Of course, members can voluntarily \\ntransfer their OA savings to the RA at any time, up to the \\nrevised ERS, to earn higher interest, and to receive higher \\nretirement payouts.  \\n \\n108. I will also enhance the retirement support schemes for seniors \\nwho need more help.  \\n \\na. The Silver Support Scheme provides quarterly payments \\nto seniors who had low incomes during their working \\nyears and have less family support. I will raise the \\nqualifying per capita household income threshold for\\n\\nPage 50 of 86 \\nSilver Support from $1,800 to $2,300, and increase the \\nquarterly payments by 20%, to keep pace with inflation. \\n \\nb. The Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (or the MRSS) \\nhelps Singaporeans aged 55 to 70 with less CPF savings to \\nsave more, by providing dollar-for-dollar matching for cash \\ntop-ups to their CPF accounts. I will make several \\nadjustments to the scheme. \\n \\nc. I will extend the MRSS to those above the age of 70. This \\nwill enable more Singaporeans to meet their retirement \\nneeds, with the help of their families, employers, and the \\ncommunity.  \\n \\nd. I will increase the annual matching cap from $600 to \\n$2,000, and set a lifetime matching cap of $20,000.  \\n \\ne. Currently, we provide a tax relief to encourage \\nSingaporeans to top up their CPF. But the matching grant \\nis already a significant benefit extended by the \\nGovernment. So we will remove the tax relief for the cash \\ntop-ups that attract the matching grant.\\n\\nPage 51 of 86 \\nf. These changes to the Silver Support Scheme and the \\nMRSS will take effect from 2025.  \\n \\n109. “Young Seniors” who are currently in their 50s and early 60s will \\nget an additional boost for their retirement through the Majulah \\nPackage. This was announced by Prime Minister Lee at last year’s \\nNational Day Rally.  \\n \\n110. While the package is geared towards supporting Young Seniors, \\nPioneer and Merdeka Generation seniors will benefit too. In fact, all \\nSingaporeans born in 1973 or earlier will receive at least one \\ncomponent of the Majulah Package. Let me explain. (See Annex F-2.) \\n \\na. First, I will provide an Earn and Save Bonus, to help \\nseniors earning up to $6,000 per month accumulate more \\nretirement savings. They will receive a yearly bonus of up \\nto $1,000 for as long as they work, with more going to \\nthose who earn lower incomes.  \\n \\nb. Second, I will provide a one-time Retirement Savings \\nBonus of between $1,000 and $1,500 to seniors with \\nretirement savings below the Basic Retirement Sum.\\n\\nPage 52 of 86 \\nc. Both these bonuses will be for seniors who live in a \\nproperty with Annual Value of $25,000 or less, and own \\nno more than one property.  \\n \\nd. Third, I will provide a one-time MediSave Bonus to all \\nseniors born in 1973 or earlier. Young Seniors with less \\nmeans will be given the higher tier of $1,500; and all \\nother seniors will receive $750.  \\n \\n111. The Minister for Manpower will share more details at the COS.  \\n \\n112. In all, the Majulah Package will benefit about 1.6 million \\nSingaporeans, at a total lifetime cost of $8.2 billion. To honour this \\ncommitment without burdening future generations, I will set aside \\n$7.5 billion in a new Fund – the Majulah Package Fund. And this will \\nbe sufficient to cover the lifetime cost of the Package, after \\naccounting for investment income of the Fund.  \\n \\nKeeping Healthcare Affordable and Accessible for All \\n \\n113. Another significant undertaking is healthcare. Over the years, \\nwe have invested heavily to ensure healthcare remains affordable \\nand accessible for all.\\n\\nPage 53 of 86 \\na. MOH’s annual budget has tripled within a decade.  \\n \\nb. And we have put the additional spending to good use. We \\nare devoting more resources to areas of growing \\nimportance, like preventive health, support for our \\nseniors, and mental health and well-being, as recently \\naffirmed by this House. We also continue to enjoy \\nimprovements in health outcomes, with Singaporeans \\nliving longer and healthier lives.  \\n \\n114. But with a rapidly ageing population, the fiscal pressures of \\nhealthcare will only grow. As a responsible Government, we have to \\nplan ahead and set aside sufficient resources to keep healthcare \\naffordable for all.  \\n \\na. The GST increase was meant for this purpose.  \\n \\nb. Essentially, we are pre-funding the rising healthcare \\nexpenditure by increasing GST now, instead of waiting to \\ndo so in the future. Because if we wait, we will end up \\nimposing a heavier burden on our future selves and our \\nchildren.\\n\\nPage 54 of 86 \\n115. Of course, individuals have a part to play too. That’s why we \\nlaunched Healthier SG to empower all Singaporeans to take charge of \\nour own health. While it is still early days, the momentum is very \\nencouraging. More than 700,000 Singapore residents have enrolled \\nin Healthier SG.  \\n \\na. One of them is Mdm Rubiah, who turns 69 this year. She \\ncredits her Healthier SG consultation for timely advice on \\nhow best to manage her health. Today, she is monitoring \\nher blood pressure daily, cutting down on ice cream and \\nkeropok in her diet, and staying active through exercise \\nclasses and nature walks. She has also helped to spread \\nthe word, by volunteering at a Healthier SG roadshow.  \\n \\nb. Sir, I urge all seniors to follow in the footsteps of Mdm \\nRubiah. Heed your doctor’s advice, participate in \\nprogrammes that help you stay healthy, and even pass it \\non by contributing as a senior volunteer.  \\n \\n116. Even with healthier lifestyles, all of us will still need some form \\nof medical care as we get older, and especially nearer to the end of \\nlife. We must expect healthcare costs, including medical insurance \\npremiums, to rise, even after generous Government subsidies.\\n\\nPage 55 of 86 \\n117. We want to ensure that all Singaporeans, including the self-\\nemployed and those who are not working, are able to build up their \\nmedical savings in anticipation of these rising costs. I will therefore \\nprovide all adult Singaporeans aged 21 to 50 a one-time MediSave \\nBonus of up to $300.  \\n \\na. This will benefit about 1.4 million Singaporeans, and help \\nthem to cover their smaller medical bills and insurance \\npremiums. (See Annex F-3.)  \\n \\nb. And coupled with the Majulah Package for older cohorts, \\nwe will collectively provide a MediSave Bonus for about 3 \\nmillion Singaporeans this year.  \\n \\n118. To provide more support for healthcare costs, I will also update \\nthe per capita household income thresholds for our healthcare and \\nassociated social support subsidy schemes.  \\n \\na. Such schemes include the MediShield Life premium \\nsubsidies, the Community Health Assist Scheme (or CHAS) \\nsubsidies for primary care, and subsidies for outpatient \\nand inpatient treatments at our public hospitals.\\n\\nPage 56 of 86 \\nb. The changes to the per capita household income \\nthresholds will mean additional Government spending in \\nhealthcare and other related areas of around $300 million \\nper year. More than 1 million Singaporeans can expect to \\nbenefit from higher subsidies. This will provide greater \\nassurance for healthcare costs, which will also reduce the \\nfinancial pressures on caregivers. (See Annex F-4.) \\n \\n119. Preventive care is especially important for seniors. Loneliness \\ncan do great harm to a senior. They need to stay active and socially \\nconnected. This is why we have Age Well SG – it is a new national \\nprogramme to support seniors to age actively, stay socially \\nconnected, and be cared for within their own communities. \\n \\n120. I will set aside $3.5 billion for Age Well SG initiatives over the \\nnext decade. And this includes several components. \\n \\na. First, an expanded network of Active Ageing Centres, so \\nthat all seniors can look forward to a wider range of \\nprogrammes at these centres, from physical exercises to \\nvolunteering opportunities.  \\n \\nb. Second, for seniors with care needs, we will develop more \\nassisted living options, such as Community Care\\n\\nPage 57 of 86 \\nApartments and better home care arrangements, to \\nempower them to age confidently in their homes and \\ncommunity.  \\n \\nc. Third, “silver upgrades” to our residential estates, to \\nenable seniors to live more independently and safely in \\nthe community. And this will cover amenities like \\ntherapeutic gardens and barrier-free ramps, and senior-\\nfriendly home fittings such as wider toilet entrances and \\nshower seats.  \\n \\nd. Fourth, improvements to our commuter infrastructure for \\nseniors’ mobility and safety. This means more sheltered \\nlinkways, bus stops with senior-friendly features, as well as \\nsafer and more pedestrian-friendly roads.  \\n \\n121. Sir, when you combine of all these efforts, the suite of \\ninvestments we are making – in education, housing, retirement, and \\nhealthcare – they speak to our steadfast commitment to address the \\nneeds of our families and seniors, through every stage of life. \\nThrough these investments, we will provide more assurance to all \\nSingaporeans – to set minds at ease, improve lives and well-being, \\nand ensure Singapore remains home truly for all of us.\\n\\nPage 58 of 86 \\nG. Forging a Stronger and More United Nation \\n \\n122. Alongside our investments to strengthen our economy and \\nsociety, we will also make the investments needed to forge a stronger \\nand more united nation. We will safeguard what makes Singapore \\nspecial and resilient – our commitment to take care of and defend \\none another, sustain the trust we have in each other and our \\ninstitutions, and build our strong sense of national pride and identity. \\n \\nA Safe and Secure Singapore \\n \\n123. Since independence, we have invested steadily to safeguard our \\npeace and security.  \\n \\na. Over the last two decades, we have allocated around 3% \\nto 4% of our GDP annually to MINDEF’s budget.  \\n \\nb. At the same time, over the past decade, our spending on \\ndomestic security has doubled to more than $8 billion, or \\nabout 1.3% of our GDP .  \\n \\nc. We will continue to build and maintain a strong and \\neffective SAF and Home Team. We will invest in them,\\n\\nPage 59 of 86 \\nupgrade their capabilities year by year, to protect \\nourselves from potential aggressors and security threats.  \\n \\n124. The backbone of our defence and security remains National \\nService. We owe a huge debt to our national servicemen, who have \\nserved faithfully, and made immeasurable sacrifices for our peace \\nand security. \\n \\na. I will therefore provide $200 in the form of LifeSG credits \\nto all past and present national servicemen, including \\nthose enlisting this year. (See Annex G-1.) \\n \\nb. It is a small gesture, but when you add it all up, it will cost \\nus $240 million and benefit 1.2 million national \\nservicemen. I hope this will go some way in expressing our \\nappreciation and gratitude to our national servicemen as \\nwell as their families for all that they have done, and will \\ncontinue to do for our country.  \\n \\n125. In today’s world, defence and security apply not just in the \\nphysical environment, but also in the digital domain. Scams, \\nransomware, data breaches, denial of service, and other cyber \\nthreats have become increasingly commonplace. The development \\nand adoption of new technologies like AI and quantum computing\\n\\nPage 60 of 86 \\nalso change the threat landscape. Cyberattacks will increase in speed, \\nscale, and sophistication. \\n \\n126. We have taken steps to strengthen our cyber defence. We \\nestablished the Digital and Intelligence Service in the SAF. We will \\nestablish a new National Cybersecurity Command Centre at the \\nPunggol Digital District to better coordinate cyber defence \\noperations, improve collaboration with industry and academia, and \\nspur innovation in cybersecurity. This will improve our capabilities to \\nmonitor, detect, and coordinate our defences against cyber threats.  \\n \\nSafeguarding Energy Security Amidst the Energy Transition \\n \\n127. Besides the conventional areas of security, we need to address \\nan emerging security challenge – and that is energy, and more \\nspecifically the transition to cleaner energy.  \\n \\n128. In the near to medium term, natural gas, which currently \\ngenerates almost all of our electricity, will remain critical.  \\n \\na. Our natural gas supplies come through pipelines from \\nMalaysia and Indonesia, and in the form of liquefied \\nnatural gas (or LNG) from a range of sources.\\n\\nPage 61 of 86 \\nb. We are now planning to build a second LNG terminal to \\nmeet our growing electricity needs.  \\n \\n129. Natural gas is the cleanest of all fossil fuels. But we will not be \\nable to achieve net zero if we continue to rely solely on natural gas. \\nUnfortunately, we do not have many options for clean energy – we \\nhave no tidal power, no wind power, and not enough land for mass \\ndeployment of solar. So, what do we do? \\n \\na. One way is to import low-carbon electricity.  \\n \\nb. And we are making progress on this front.  \\n \\nc. But there is a limit to importing electricity without \\ncompromising security. So we will need other options to \\ndecarbonise the rest of our energy supply. \\n \\n130. And that is why we are actively exploring other options.  \\n \\na. Hydrogen has the potential as a clean fuel. For now, it is \\nstill technologically nascent, costly, and risky. \\nNevertheless, we have set out a National Hydrogen \\nStrategy to take purposeful steps forward. We will start by \\ntesting and deploying ammonia, which is a hydrogen\\n\\nPage 62 of 86 \\ncarrier, for power generation and bunkering on Jurong \\nIsland.  \\n \\nb. We are also exploring other energy sources. We are \\nactively studying the possibilities for geothermal power. \\nAfter all, we do have a hot spring in Sembawang. But we \\nwill need very deep drilling to assess the potential, and it \\nreally remains to be seen if this will be viable. \\n \\nc. Further out in the future, we do not rule out nuclear \\npower. Nuclear technologies are advancing rapidly, with \\nsmaller, safer, and more fuel-efficient designs. We will \\nbuild up our capabilities, so that we can critically assess \\nthe evolving technologies in this space and decide on the \\nfeasibility of nuclear deployment one day in the future.  \\n \\n131. There is considerable uncertainty as to how all these energy \\npathways will work out. What is clear, however, is that significant \\neffort and costs will be needed to transit from a system powered \\nalmost entirely by natural gas to one powered largely by clean \\nenergy.  \\n \\na. We say this is an “energy transition”. Transition is a rather \\ninnocuous word. But the scale of this so-called transition\\n\\nPage 63 of 86 \\nis massive, and we will need to get it done over the next \\ntwo decades or so, which is not a lot of time, when you \\nthink about the enormity of the task.  \\n \\nb. For example, to import low-carbon electricity, we will \\nneed to invest in submarine cables and upgrade our \\nexisting power grid. Or if we decide to scale up the use of \\nhydrogen, we will need to put in place new infrastructure \\nfor generation, storage, and delivery. All of these \\ninvestments will be costly. They cannot be done by the \\nprivate sector alone, and will likely need some catalytic \\nfunding from the Government.  \\n \\nc. I will therefore set up a Future Energy Fund with an initial \\ninjection of $5 billion. This will give us the confidence to \\ninvest in good time, put us in a better position to move \\nquickly on critical infrastructure, and enhance our security \\nin clean energy.  \\n \\nBuilding a United Nation \\n \\n132. The resilience of our nation of course is not only measured by \\nwhat we spend, or by our infrastructure and hardware. Rather, our \\ntrue resilience lies within – in the strong bonds Singaporeans have\\n\\nPage 64 of 86 \\nforged among ourselves and in our collective willingness to take care \\nof one another. Every Singaporean man, woman, and child knows he \\nor she belongs to this island nation, everyone has a place in our \\nsociety, each has a role to play in our unfolding Singapore story. That \\nis the essence of Total Defence, which we commemorated for the \\n40th time yesterday.  \\n \\n133. We nurture these bonds between Singaporeans by \\nstrengthening our culture of giving.  \\n \\na. There are many who have done well in Singapore and \\nthey want to give back, but they may not know how or \\nwhere to start.  \\n \\nb. We will do more to help these donors better appreciate \\nthe needs of our society and advise them on how to more \\neffectively direct their resources – financial or non-\\nfinancial – to support lower-income families. This effort \\nwill be led by the Community Foundation of Singapore, in \\npartnership with MSF and the Community Chest.  \\n \\nc. In the same spirit, we want to encourage charities to work \\ntogether to uplift each other and better meet the needs of \\ntheir beneficiaries. I will do so by extending the Charities\\n\\nPage 65 of 86 \\nCapability Fund Collaboration Grant for three years till \\nend-FY2026. This will support collaborative projects \\namong charities to enhance their governance, efficiency, \\nand capabilities.  \\n \\n134. Doing good also extends beyond our shores. Many \\nSingaporeans readily step forward to support those affected by \\nhumanitarian crises overseas.  \\n \\na. We saw this in the relief efforts following the devasting \\nearthquake in Türkiye and Syria last year; and also in the \\ngenerous donations in response to the human tragedy \\narising from the Israel-Hamas conflict.  \\n \\nb. To encourage Singaporeans to support those in need \\noverseas, I will introduce an Overseas Humanitarian \\nAssistance Tax Deduction Scheme. This will provide 100% \\ntax deductions for cash donations made towards overseas \\nemergency humanitarian assistance causes through \\ndesignated charities. This will run for four years as a pilot \\nscheme. (See Annex G-2.) \\n \\n135. A stronger culture of giving will bind us closer together, and \\nmake us a more caring and gracious society.\\n\\nPage 66 of 86 \\n \\n136. Another way to strengthen our solidarity is through the \\ncommon experiences we all partake in. And the arts and sports \\nprovide us with the platforms to do so.  \\n \\n137. Let me start with the arts. The arts help to express our unique \\nSingaporean culture, strengthen our shared bonds, and make \\nSingapore a distinctive home. \\n \\na. The National Arts Council has refreshed Our SG Arts Plan \\nto drive transformation efforts in the arts sector. We will \\nsupport this plan by investing $100 million over the next \\nfour years.  \\n \\nb. As part of this plan, we aim to make the arts more \\naccessible to all Singaporeans. We will unlock more \\nopportunities and touchpoints for our artists to infuse the \\narts everywhere in our city, and in our communities.  \\n \\nc. The additional investments will also strengthen the \\nfoundation for a more vibrant arts industry. NAC will \\nsupport arts groups to develop and showcase their \\ndiverse offerings as well as to strengthen our talent pool. \\nSelf-employed artists will also benefit from more\\n\\nPage 67 of 86 \\ndevelopment opportunities to broaden and deepen their \\nskills.  \\n \\n138. Apart from the arts, there are few endeavours that can rally the \\ncountry and ignite the Singapore spirit like sports. From the \\ngrassroots to the global stage, from community participation to high-\\nperformance, sports bring Singaporeans from all walks of life \\ntogether.  \\n \\n139. At the grassroots level, we will enable more Singaporeans to \\nparticipate in sports by continuing to support the Sports Facilities \\nMaster Plan. With this, Singaporeans can look forward to new and \\nrejuvenated sports centres in Toa Payoh, Punggol, and Clementi, as \\nwell as more sports and recreational facilities in our neighbourhoods.  \\n \\n140. Many Singaporeans want to support our national athletes, and \\nwe will provide them with more platforms to do so.  \\n \\n141. We will anchor more major sports events in Singapore, so that \\nour athletes can compete in top-tier competitions against the world’s \\nbest on home ground, and this will also allow more Singaporeans to \\ncheer for Team Singapore.\\n\\nPage 68 of 86 \\n142. We now have the One Team Singapore Fund, which provides \\ndollar-for-dollar matching for donations towards Team Singapore \\nathletes.  \\n \\na. I will provide a $20 million top-up for the One Team \\nSingapore Fund and extend it till end-FY2027.  \\n \\nb. In addition, I will broaden the scope of donations eligible \\nfor matching to cover athletes in emerging sports, like \\npickleball, tchoukball, and powerlifting. I will also include \\nSportCares, which provides opportunities for vulnerable \\nchildren and youth, persons with disabilities, and seniors \\nto participate in sporting programmes.  \\n \\n143. The Minister for Culture, Community, and Youth will share more \\nabout our arts and sports initiatives at the COS. \\n \\n144. Sir, everywhere in the world, we see societies becoming \\nincreasingly divided, and nations becoming more and more fragile. \\nEconomic growth or social transfers alone cannot guarantee that we \\nsucceed.  \\n \\n145. This Budget therefore invests in our national resilience – from \\nensuring the effectiveness of our military and domestic security, to\\n\\nPage 69 of 86 \\nsafeguarding our energy security and building a stronger national \\nidentity. These will shield us from external threats and the forces that \\nthreaten to pull us apart. Only then can we be confident that \\nSingapore will endure.\\n\\nPage 70 of 86 \\nH. Securing Our Fiscal Position \\n \\n146. Our ability to invest in our economy, our society, and our \\nresilience has to be anchored on a strong fiscal position. \\n  \\n147. Fiscal responsibility has always been a key part of the Singapore \\nDNA. We spend our resources wisely, and we take great care to \\nprovide for our children and grandchildren. This is why I made major \\nrevenue moves in the last two Budgets. These moves have put us on \\na stronger fiscal footing for the next decade, while ensuring that our \\noverall system of public finances remains fair and progressive.  \\n \\nTax Changes  \\n \\n148. This year, in light of concerns over cost of living, I will provide a \\nPersonal Income Tax Rebate of 50% for the Year of Assessment 2024. \\n \\na. This will be capped at $200 so that the benefits go mostly \\nto our middle-income workers.  \\n \\nb. The rebate will cost the Government $350 million. \\n \\n149. Currently, taxpayers may claim a range of dependant-related \\nreliefs, if their dependants have an annual income of $4,000 or less.\\n\\nPage 71 of 86 \\nWe have received feedback from members of public, tax \\npractitioners, as well as Labour MPs, to consider increasing the \\ndependant income threshold in view of rising cost of living and wage \\nlevels. So with effect from the Year of Assessment 2025, I will \\nincrease the annual income threshold for dependant-related reliefs \\nfrom $4,000 to $8,000. \\n \\n150. In Budget 2022, I announced a two-step increase in Property \\nTax rates for residential properties. This was meant as a wealth tax, \\ntargeted at all investment properties, as well as the higher-end \\nsegment of owner-occupied properties.  \\n \\n151. Prior to that Budget announcement, market rents had been \\nrelatively flat for the preceding five years. But from 2022 onwards, \\nmarket rents increased significantly due to the combination of strong \\ndemand and Covid-related supply constraints. As a result, the Annual \\nValues (or the AVs) also increased sharply. We had originally expected \\nthe Property Tax changes to impact mainly the top 7% of owner-\\noccupied residential properties. But the AV increases resulted in the \\nproportion of affected owner-occupied properties nearly doubling to \\n13%.  \\n \\n152. In light of these market trends, I will raise all the AV bands of \\nthe owner-occupier residential Property Tax rates with effect from 1\\n\\nPage 72 of 86 \\nJanuary 2025. Currently, Property Tax is charged on the bands of AV \\nfrom $8,000 to over $100,000. I will raise the lower threshold from \\n$8,000 to $12,000 and the highest band from over $100,000 to over \\n$140,000, and corresponding adjustments will be made to the bands \\nin between. This will still uphold the intent of the Property Tax \\nchanges, and ensure that those residing in higher-value properties \\ncontinue to pay their fair share of taxes.  \\n \\n153. And the Government had provided a rebate to cushion the \\nimpact of the Property Tax changes this year. We will continue to \\nclosely monitor the property market, and will provide another rebate \\nin 2025 if needed. \\n \\n154. We recognise that there are retirees living in higher-end \\nresidential homes, who face cash flow issues when paying their \\nProperty Tax bills. To help them, IRAS will offer a 24-month \\ninstalment plan without any interest. They can apply for this via IRAS’ \\nwebsite or contact IRAS for more details.  \\n \\n155. Next, I will adjust the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (or the \\nABSD) for the purchase of residential properties.  \\n \\na. Today, married couples with an existing residential \\nproperty can enjoy an ABSD refund on their replacement\\n\\nPage 73 of 86 \\nprivate property under the ABSD concession for \\nSingaporean married couples.   \\n \\nb. To better support seniors who wish to right-size, I will \\nextend the concession to single Singapore Citizens aged \\n55 and above. In other words, these seniors will be able \\nto claim a refund of ABSD paid on their replacement \\nprivate property, if they sell their first property within six \\nmonths after purchasing a lower-value replacement \\nprivate property. This extension will take effect from \\ntoday.  \\n \\n156. I will also introduce some flexibility to the ABSD regime for \\nhousing developers.  \\n \\na. Housing developers are now granted an ABSD remission, \\nprovided they sell all the units in their development \\nwithin a prescribed sale timeline.  \\n \\nb. But despite their best efforts, the developers sometimes \\nface difficulties in meeting this timeline requirement. \\nThey are then subject to a full clawback of the ABSD.\\n\\nPage 74 of 86 \\nc. I will lower the ABSD clawback rate, should developers \\nsell at least 90% of each development within the \\nprescribed sale timeline. This ensures that housing supply \\ncontinues to be released promptly, while providing some \\nflexibility to the developers. The details of this change will \\nbe released in a statement later today.  \\n \\nBEPS 2.0  \\n \\n157. Next: Corporate Income Tax – I will make significant \\nadjustments to our tax system to take into consideration the \\ninternational Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (or BEPS) 2.0 initiative.  \\n \\n158. To recap, BEPS comprises two pillars:  \\n \\na. Pillar One aims to reallocate taxing rights on profits to \\nmarket jurisdictions. When implemented, it will result in \\nrevenue losses for Singapore. \\n \\nb. Pillar One has been delayed for now, and the \\nimplementation date remains unclear. \\n \\nc. Pillar Two will introduce a global minimum effective tax \\nrate of 15% for large MNE groups.\\n\\nPage 75 of 86 \\n \\nd. Last Budget, I announced our intention to implement \\nPillar Two from 2025, and that we would monitor and \\nadjust the timeline if needed.  \\n \\ne. Since then, several jurisdictions have moved. The EU, the \\nUK, Switzerland, Japan, and Korea are implementing Pillar \\nTwo rules from 2024. Others, like Hong Kong and \\nMalaysia, have announced their plans to do so from 2025.  \\n \\n159. We will therefore move ahead with two components of Pillar \\nTwo, as planned.  \\n \\na. The first is the Income Inclusion Rule (or IIR). A \\njurisdiction that introduces this will subject the overseas \\nprofits of MNE groups parented in that jurisdiction to a \\nminimum effective tax rate of 15%.  \\n \\nb. So we will implement the IIR. In other words, MNE groups \\nthat are parented in Singapore will have to pay a \\nminimum effective tax rate of 15% on their groups’ \\noverseas profits, regardless of where they operate.\\n\\nPage 76 of 86 \\nc. The second component is the Domestic Top-up Tax (or \\nthe DTT). This applies to the Singapore profits of MNE \\ngroups operating here. Without this tax, these MNE \\ngroups would have had to pay their parent jurisdictions \\nthe effective tax rate of 15% on their Singapore profits. \\nTherefore, it is in our interest to implement the DTT, so \\nthat we collect the tax, rather than have it go somewhere \\nelse.  \\n \\nd. The IIR and the DTT will take effect for businesses’ \\nfinancial years starting on or after 1 January 2025, and will \\napply to large MNE groups with global revenue of at least \\n750 million euros annually. \\n \\n160. There is another component of Pillar Two: the Undertaxed \\nProfits Rule.  \\n \\na. This is effectively a backstop, as it will allow Singapore to \\ncollect a share of the top-up tax on any MNE with \\noperations here, if any portion of its income overseas has \\nnot been subject to the minimum tax.  \\n \\nb. We will consider this at a later stage. Because with the \\nDTT and IIR, we are already making major changes to our\\n\\nPage 77 of 86 \\ncorporate tax regime. So we will focus on implementing \\nthese changes first, and ensure a smooth rollout for the \\naffected companies.  \\n \\n161. In the short term, the implementation of Pillar Two will provide \\nadditional revenues. But it is uncertain how much this will be or how \\nlong it will last. We may even see a reduction in our tax base, should \\nMNEs shift some of their activities to other jurisdictions in response \\nto the new business environment.  \\n \\n162. In any case, whatever additional revenues we obtain from Pillar \\nTwo will need to be reinvested for Singapore to stay competitive in a \\npost-BEPS world.  \\n \\na. MNEs are now re-evaluating their plans and strategies. \\nOther governments are also enhancing and refreshing \\ntheir investment promotion toolkits. \\n \\nb. That is why we are introducing the Refundable Investment \\nCredit, which I mentioned earlier. We will also have to \\nspend more to support new investments, research and \\ninnovation activities, and sustain our economic \\ncompetitiveness.\\n\\nPage 78 of 86 \\nc. Overall, given the significant spending required to stay \\ncompetitive, at this point, I do not expect the new moves \\nto generate net revenue gains for Singapore on a \\nsustained basis.  \\n \\n163. I will also make some further tax adjustments, to ensure our tax \\nsystem remains fair and competitive. And details of the tax changes \\nare in the Annex to the Budget. (See Annex H-1.)  \\n \\nMedium-Term Outlook \\n \\n164. Sir, last year, the Ministry of Finance released a set of \\nprojections of our medium-term fiscal outlook.  \\n \\na. These showed that Government spending has been rising \\nsteadily over the years.  \\n \\nb. Our spending in the late 2000s was around 15% of GDP . \\nAnd over the span of ten years, it has grown by 3 \\npercentage points of GDP, to around 18% of GDP .  \\n \\nc. We expect spending to continue rising in this decade. \\nHealthcare is one key driver for the increase. But there are \\nadditional spending needs fuelling the increase.\\n\\nPage 79 of 86 \\n \\nd. We will have to spend more for the major moves to \\ndecarbonise our economy, as I explained earlier.  \\n \\ne. As part of Forward Singapore, we are making significant \\npolicy shifts to strengthen our social safety nets, and \\nprovide more assurance to Singaporeans. I have just \\nintroduced some of these measures in this year’s Budget. \\nWe will spend around $5 billion on Forward Singapore \\npolicy moves in FY2024, and close to $40 billion in total by \\nthe end of this decade.  \\n \\n165. In our projections, MOF had assessed that Government \\nspending will increase to around 20% of GDP by 2030. For now, that \\nremains our assessment. Assuming we stay within this range of \\nspending increase, we should have sufficient revenues to maintain a \\nbalanced budget over the coming years.  \\n \\n166. But the medium-term fiscal position is tight. Because there are \\nso many pressures for us to spend more, be it on healthcare, social \\nneeds, or the energy transition, and these are all big-ticket items. We \\nwill have to manage these expenditures carefully, or we will end up \\nwith a significant funding gap.\\n\\nPage 80 of 86 \\n167. We can already see this happening in many other advanced \\neconomies where public finances are on an unsustainable path, and \\nfiscal systems are at risk of breaking. We must never allow this to \\nhappen in Singapore. Instead, let us uphold the ethos of fiscal \\ndiscipline and responsibility that has served us well, and ensure that \\nour fiscal position always remains balanced, sound, and sustainable.  \\n \\nFY2023 and FY2024 Fiscal Position  \\n \\n168. Sir, let me now summarise our fiscal position for both FY2023 \\nand FY2024.  \\n \\n169. For FY2023, our revenue collections were better than expected. \\nAnd this was mainly due to higher Corporate Income Tax collections.  \\n \\n170. The additional revenue will allow us to pay for new spending, \\nincluding the $7.5 billion injection to the Majulah Package Fund.  \\n \\n171. Accounting for both our revenue upside and higher spending, \\nwe expect to end FY2023 with a deficit of $3.6 billion, or 0.5% of GDP .  \\n \\n172. For FY2024, we are budgeting a small surplus of $0.8 billion, or \\n0.1% of GDP, which is essentially a balanced fiscal position. The \\noverall stance is appropriate, as we are providing targeted support\\n\\nPage 81 of 86 \\nfor households and businesses, even as the economy is projected to \\noperate at around potential. (See Annex H-2.)\\n\\nPage 82 of 86 \\nI. Conclusion \\n \\n173. Mr Speaker, let me conclude.  \\n \\n174. We are living in a world which will become more violent, more \\nfragmented, and more unpredictable in the years to come.  \\n \\na. We wish this were not so.  \\n \\nb. We will try our best, working with others in the \\ninternational community, to shape better global \\noutcomes.  \\n \\nc. But we also have to be realistic. Great catastrophes often \\nseem unthinkable until they happen. Things may well get \\nworse before they get better. So let us be mentally \\nprepared, and take steps now to adapt to this messy \\nworld.  \\n \\n175. This is not the first time that we’ve found ourselves in such a \\nsituation.  \\n \\na. Since our independence, we’ve had to adjust to all sorts of \\nexternal disruptions and shocks.\\n\\nPage 83 of 86 \\n \\nb. The British deciding to withdraw troops from Singapore in \\n1967; the global oil crises in 1973 and 1979; the Asian \\nFinancial Crisis in 1997; the dot-com bust in the early \\n2000s; 9/11; SARS; the Global Financial Crisis of 2008; and \\nof course, more recently the Covid-19 pandemic.  \\n \\nc. Each time, we were able to weather the storms, and \\nemerge stronger.  \\n \\nd. I believe we can do so again in our road ahead – so long as \\nwe stay united, work together, and continue to keep faith \\nin each other.  \\n \\n176. Budget 2024 is about acting on this belief. We are helping \\nSingaporeans with their cost-of-living concerns. We are taking major \\nsteps to advance our Forward Singapore agenda.  \\n \\na. We will grow the economy. We must. For growth is the \\npre-requisite to create better jobs and raise living \\nstandards for all.  \\n \\nb. We will equip everyone to realise their full potential, and \\nensure that everyone benefits from our nation’s progress.\\n\\nPage 84 of 86 \\n \\nc. We will strengthen our system of risk pooling and social \\nsupport, so that Singaporeans can be better assured \\nthrough every life stage, and better equipped to bounce \\nback from every setback.  \\n \\nd. We will fortify our resilience, solidarity, and unity, so that \\nwe remain strong and effective against any challenges or \\nthreats.  \\n \\n177. We are not the only country adapting to a different world. \\nCountries everywhere are searching for solutions too. Many find it \\nhard to implement bold and long-term plans.  \\n \\n178. But we can make it happen in Singapore.  \\n \\n179. We are able to do so because: \\n \\na. Our fiscal position is healthy and sustainable.  \\n \\nb. Our Government has the trust of Singaporeans.  \\n \\nc. Our people are united, and our social compact is strong.\\n\\nPage 85 of 86 \\n180. These are the critical ingredients behind the Singapore story.  \\n \\na. What we have today is rare, remarkable, and unique.  \\n \\nb. Let us cherish it, treasure it, and harness these strengths \\nto remain a shining red dot in a troubled world.  \\n \\n181. During the dark days of Covid-19, which feels like a bad dream \\nto all of us now, I remember visiting Riverside Secondary School. The \\nteacher had asked the students to imagine what they would be doing \\nin ten years’ time, and to write a letter to their future selves.  \\n \\na. One student – Levin Ong – wrote, and I quote: “Dear \\nfuture Levin, I hope you have been well in these past ten \\nyears. I am grateful for how Singapore is dealing with \\nCovid-19… the challenges I face are small compared to \\nothers during this difficult time. I want the world to be a \\nbetter place and contribute back to society to the best of \\nmy ability. I hope, by 2030, I have made a better world for \\neveryone.”  \\n \\nb. Hope for the future. Giving back to society. Each one of us \\ndoing our best to make this a better place for all.\\n\\nPage 86 of 86 \\n182. Mr Speaker, let us draw inspiration from young Singaporeans \\nlike Levin, move forward with confidence, and build our shared \\nfuture together.  \\n \\n183. Sir, I beg to move.'"

      "\n",
      "2. Sir, the past year has not been easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. The international environment was troubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. |The global economy was subdued.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Our own economy grew by a modest 1.1%, avoiding a recession.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. | know that many households are feeling the pressure of higher living costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Fortunately, we had some unexpected revenue upside from our strong economic rebound in the preceding two\n",

      "years.\n",

      "b. — And this is why the Government was able to enhance its assistance measures to relieve the burden on households.\n",
      "\n",
      "For 2024, the outlook is mixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Growth in the major economies on the whole is expected to remain resilient.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. — But geopolitical risks continue to loom large.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Wars are raging in Europe and the Middle East.\n",
      "\n",
      "d. These conflicts can escalate dangerously, leading to disruptions in global energy markets and supply chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, there are some upsides.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Global inflationary pressures are expected to recede further. This may provide room for the major central banks to adopt more accommodative stances, which can help to ease financial conditions and support demand.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The global electronics industry is expected to recover. will bolster the growth of many regional economies, including our key trading partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Asia continues to be a key driver of global growth, with a wider spread of opportunities across the region — not just in China, but also in India and many parts of Southeast Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Overall, we are cautiously optimistic that 2024 will be a better year. Besides lower inflation, we expect higher GDP growth at 1.0% to 3.0%.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. But there is considerable uncertainty in the outlook and the risks are tilted to the downside.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. The international environment has darkened dramatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "The post-Cold War era that began in the early 90s and fostered three decades of peace and stability is over.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are now in a new era of conflict and confrontation, and there is no turning back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 5 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "This\n",
      "\n",
      "d. What can we expect in this new world?\n",
      "\n",
      "e.\n",
      "\n",
      "— It will be more violent. We already see a growing zone impunity involving armed conflict and terrorism that cannot be easily resolved by the global community.\n",
      "\n",
      "f.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be more fragmented. Because the major powers prioritising national security over economic interdependence, and the traditional modes of cooperation are breaking down.\n",
      "\n",
      "g. It will be messier and more unpredictable. Because there will be diminished willingness and capacity to tackle global issues, be it responding to future pandemics or tackling climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. | These are the stark realities before us. For some time to come, Singapore will have to operate in an external environment that will be less stable and favourable to our security and prosperity than the preceding three decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. That is why we embarked on the Forward Singapore exercise — to refresh our social compact to keep our society strong and united,\n",

      "\n",
      "For as one united people, we can overcome all odds.\n",

      "Some are ready to be implemented now.\n",

      "d. _Inthis Budget, we will roll out the first instalment of our Forward Singapore programmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Budget 2024 is therefore about taking concrete steps to build our shared future together. We will:\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Tackle immediate challenges for households and businesses;\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Pursue better jobs, better growth, and equip our workers for life;\n",

      "\n",
      "Page 8 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Tackling Immediate Challenges\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Sir, we have enjoyed low inflation in Singapore for more than a decade. But inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, which led to significant increases in global energy and food prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Despite the unprecedented surge in prices, we had good economic growth in 2022. So incomes that year rose faster than inflation and Singaporeans were better off, in real terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Unfortunately, this did not happen last year. Inflation had in fact started to moderate. But economic growth also slowed. As a result, real incomes declined.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. We had picked up early indicators of this negative trend. And that is why | introduced the Cost-of-Living Support Package in September last year, and enhanced the Assurance Package to over $10 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. While we expect the situation to improve this year, there are uncertainties in the outlook as | mentioned just now. So in this Budget, | will do more to support households and further enhance the Assurance Package.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 9 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "First, | will provide an additional $600 in CDC Vouchers for all Singaporean households. The first $300 will be disbursed in end-June this year. The remaining $300 will be disbursed in January next year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, | will provide a Cost-of-Living Special Payment of between $200 and $400 in cash. This will be extended to adult Singaporeans with Assessable Income of up to $100,000, and who do not own more than one property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, | will provide additional one-off U-Save rebates help households cope with increases in their utility bills. In total, eligible HDB households can expect to receive two-and-a-half times the amount of regular U-Save rebates, or up to $950, in FY2024. This will cover about four months of utility bills for those living in 3- and 4- room flats.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, | will provide an additional one-off Service and Conservancy Charges (or S&CC) Rebate for HDB flats. Together with the regular S&CC rebates, eligible HDB households will receive up to four months of such rebates in FY2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 10 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "to\n",
      "\n",
      "e. Altogether, the additional support under the Assurance Package will cost $1.9 billion. (See Annex B-1 for details of the enhanced Assurance Package.)\n",
      "\n",
      "18. We have designed this Package so that lower-income families get more support. We have also ensured that larger households, particularly those with seniors and children, get more support.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. Let me give some illustrations:\n",
      "\n",
      "a. A lower-income household of four, with two young children, will receive about $5,500 in benefits in FY2024. This comprises cash, MediSave top-ups, U-Save and S&CC rebates, and CDC Vouchers.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. A middle-income household of four, with two young children, will receive about $3,000 in benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Amiddle-income household with six persons — a larger family — including two seniors and two young children, will receive about $8,000 in benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 11 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "20. Sir, these are concrete ways to help Singaporeans tackle cost-of- living pressures. Let me assure everyone: we will always have your backs.\n",
      "\n",
      "21. Beyond the Assurance Package, | will top up the GST Voucher Fund by S6 billion. This delivers on our commitment to permanently defray GST expenses for lower- and middle-income households, through the GST Voucher scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. Businesses also need help to manage rising costs. Many companies have seen increases in their wage bills, rental, and utilities, amongst others. | will therefore introduce an Enterprise Support Package, which will provide $1.3 billion in support to companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. _ First, companies will receive a 50% Corporate Income Tax Rebate, capped at $40,000, in the Year of Assessment 2024. Not all companies are profitable, and some may not benefit from such a rebate. So | will provide a minimum benefit of $2,000 in cash payouts for companies that employed at least one local employee in 2023.\n",
      "\n",
      "b.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, | will enhance the Enterprise Financing Scheme, which helps Singapore enterprises with their financing\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 12 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "needs. The maximum working capital loan quantum will be permanently raised to $500,000. | will also extend until 31 March 2025 the enhanced maximum trade loan quantum, as well as the Government’s risk sharing of project loans to support domestic construction projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, | will extend the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit by a year to 30 June 2025. The Credit provides additional support for eligible employers to cover their out-of-pocket expenses when they embark on workforce and business transformation. With this extension, employers will have another year to claim any unused credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The measures in this Enterprise Support Package are tilted towards firms that make the effort to restructure and transform. | encourage all firms to make full use of these schemes, so that they can thrive and succeed, amidst a more challenging operating environment. (See Annex B-2 for details of Enterprise Support Package.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The enhanced Assurance Package and the Enterprise Support Package will provide some near-term relief to Singaporean households and firms. These are needed during this period when inflation, while moderating, remains on the high side. But they are\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 13 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "not permanent solutions. In the longer term, the best way to deal with inflation is to ensure that our firms and workers are more productive, and that real incomes continue to rise sustainably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 14 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Pursuing Better Growth and Jobs\n",
      "\n",
      "24. Our key priority therefore is to ensure a strong, innovative, and vibrant economy. This is absolutely essential to secure good jobs and better lives for all Singaporeans, and on a sustained basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "25. Since our early days of independence, we have been able to defy the odds and consistently achieve good economic performance. But we cannot afford to be complacent, especially in a more complex and volatile external environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "26. In past years, some had suggested that Singapore should slow down; don’t have to grow so quickly. Indeed, this was what happened last year — our economy grew by just about 1%. But if we were to experience similarly slow growth for several years in a row, we will be in trouble. We will have no chance of improving our collective well-being. Singaporeans’ living standards will be dented. We will not be able to afford the social services we need. And in the end, lower-income workers and families will be hit the hardest.\n",
      "\n",
      "27. We therefore make no apology for pursuing growth. To be clear, we are not going for growth at all costs. There is a limit to how fast we can grow due to the tighter constraints we face in land, labour, and carbon. But by focusing on productivity and innovation, we can\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 15 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "push the frontier and grow at an average of about 2% to 3% each year over the next decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "28. Now, this is an ambitious goal given our stage of economic development. But we must aim high, so that Singapore keeps moving forward, and our people continue to enjoy more opportunities and a better quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anchoring Quality Investments\n",
      "\n",
      "29. Acrucial enabler for growth is our ability to attract high-quality and high-value investments to Singapore, because such projects bring the latest know-how and capabilities, and create good jobs for Singaporeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "30. So far, our investment pipeline has been healthy. Despite a challenging external environment last year, EDB exceeded its targets, and brought in investments which are expected to create over 20,000 new jobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "31. But the competition for investments is getting tougher.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. | Governments around the world are rolling out vast subsidies to attract investments, especially in strategic\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 16 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "industries. For example, in November last year, Japan announced that it would allocate 2 trillion yen, or about $18 billion, to support its semiconductor industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. | We cannot afford to engage in a “bidding war” with the major economies.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. But neither should we stand still and just do nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "32. We will therefore enhance our investment promotion toolkit by introducing a new Refundable Investment Credit. (See Annex C-1.)\n",
      "\n",
      "a. This is a tax credit with a refundable cash feature. It will support high-value and substantive economic activities, including the setting up or expansion of manufacturing facilities; new innovation and R&D activities; as well as activities in support of the green transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "b.\n",
      "\n",
      "— Essentially, this new tax credit will help us stay competitive and attract investments from global companies with the right know-how, and create good jobs for Singaporeans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 17 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "33. To support this and other investment promotion efforts, | will top up the National Productivity Fund by $2 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building on Our Strengths\n",
      "\n",
      "34. Besides anchoring new investments, we must build on our existing strengths, and upgrade the sectors where we have competitive advantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "35. These advantages did not come about by chance. They are the result of many decades of hard work to restructure and to upgrade our economy. We did not just keep costs competitive. We also enhanced our capabilities and moved up the value chain, so as to justify the higher premiums for operating out of Singapore. And we are pressing on with these restructuring efforts through the Industry Transformation Maps.\n",
      "\n",
      "36. Take semiconductors as one example. Singapore is not the cheapest location worldwide. But we have many things going for us our excellent connectivity, our reliability and stable business environment, and also a critical mass of leading companies based here. And they operate across the value chain, from design, to wafer fabrication, to assembly and testing. The companies here do not produce cutting-edge 3 nm chips, which you will read about in the\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 18 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "—\n",
      "\n",
      "media these days. But they have carved out a niche in other types of chips, like specialty chips and NAND flash memory chips. These are critical enablers of automation, 5G, electric vehicles, and they are in high demand. And that is how this little red dot can be a key node in the semiconductor supply chain — we account on our own for more than 10% of the global semiconductor market, and 20% of semiconductor equipment in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "37. Likewise in finance, we are a leading centre in Asia, supporting businesses from all over the world. During this period of global uncertainty, we have been able to distinguish ourselves as a stable and trusted financial centre. The major financial institutions are keen to do more out of Singapore, and we are seeing a continued inflow of investments, capital, and talent.\n",

      "\n",
      "d.\n",

      "68. Sir, we are making a significant enhancement to our SkillsFuture ecosystem. But we will reap the full benefits only if all of us — government, employers, workers, and unions — lean forward to truly deepen this culture of lifelong learning and skills mastery. This must be our shared commitment to one another — to help our fellow Singaporeans develop to their fullest potential, and to have productive and meaningful careers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supporting the Involuntarily Unemployed\n",
      "\n",
      "69. There is one other move we will make under SkillsFuture. We know that technological changes will bring about more churn in the economy. Even when the economy as a whole is doing well, some businesses or even some industries may be suffering. In fact, it is not possible to have an economy that is dynamic and growing without\n",

      "failures and losses. In some sectors, firms will have to let go of people, while in other sectors, new and better jobs will be created.\n",
      "\n",
      "70. We have to accept this reality. But it doesn’t mean we should be indifferent to the suffering caused when firms lay off their workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "71. Losing a job is a major setback for workers and their families. Those who become involuntarily unemployed naturally feel the pressure to rush into the first available job they find. But the new job may not always be a good fit. Ideally, they should consider ways to upgrade their skills, and to find a job that fits their aptitude and talent. Displaced workers may not have the time to train or search for new jobs, especially when they are already straining to make ends meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "72. Therefore, we will do more to support this group of workers. In particular, we will introduce a temporary financial support scheme for the involuntarily unemployed, while they undergo training or look for better-fitting jobs.\n",

      "\n",
      "75. Indeed, we embarked on the Forward Singapore exercise because we do not want to succumb to the kind of harsh inequality we see in so many parts of the world. By creating more paths towards equality and mobility, we also put ourselves in a better position for continued growth — in other words, a strong economy and a strong society reinforce each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "76. But tackling inequality is often easier said than done. Ideas on how to do so are frequently replete with unintended consequences. Simple handouts and blunt measures do not solve poverty. This is why Singapore has continually paved our own way since the beginning. We carefully study the experiences of others. We take note of where they have succeeded and failed. We introduce significant innovations that work for us, our ethos, our society. This the Singapore way.\n",

      "\n",
      "80. Second, | will raise the Local Qualifying Salary (or the LQS). All local employees at companies that hire foreign workers must be paid at least the LQS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 36 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "a. The LQS for full-time workers will be raised from $1,400 to $1,600 from this year. The minimum hourly rate will be increased from $9 to $10.50 per hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. — This increase ensures we keep pace with wage growth.\n",

      "d. And to provide for these enhancements, | will top up the PWCS Fund by $1 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "82. Besides uplifting lower-wage workers, we also want to improve wages across different professions. There will always be differences in wages in any society. But too large a gap creates unhealthy levels of anxiety and stress. Parents and children may get caught up in an education arms race, or may feel pressured to prioritise careers only in a few traditional fields, instead of focusing on their individual strengths and talents.\n",

      "83. In fact, the vast majority of Singaporeans in the Forward Singapore engagements welcome broader definitions of success. We want more diverse pathways so that every individual can strive to be the best possible version of themselves. This also means we must accord greater value to those who are skilled in technical hands-on abilities, as well as those with the social and empathetic traits to excel in service jobs.

      "\n",
      "Page 70 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "We have received feedback from members of public, tax practitioners, as well as Labour MPs, to consider increasing the dependant income threshold in view of rising cost of living and wage levels. So with effect from the Year of Assessment 2025, | will increase the annual income threshold for dependant-related reliefs from $4,000 to $8,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "150. In Budget 2022, | announced a two-step increase in Property Tax rates for residential properties. This was meant as a wealth tax, targeted at all investment properties, as well as the higher-end segment of owner-occupied properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "151. Prior to that Budget announcement, market rents had been relatively flat for the preceding five years. But from 2022 onwards, market rents increased significantly due to the combination of strong demand and Covid-related supply constraints. As a result, the Annual Values (or the AVs) also increased sharply. We had originally expected the Property Tax changes to impact mainly the top 7% of owner- occupied residential properties. But the AV increases resulted in the proportion of affected owner-occupied properties nearly doubling to 13%.\n",
      "\n",
      "152. In light of these market trends, | will raise all the AV bands of the owner-occupier residential Property Tax rates with effect from 1\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 71 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "January 2025. Currently, Property Tax is charged on the bands of AV from $8,000 to over $100,000. | will raise the lower threshold from $8,000 to $12,000 and the highest band from over $100,000 to over $140,000, and corresponding adjustments will be made to the bands in between. This will still uphold the intent of the Property Tax changes, and ensure that those residing in higher-value properties continue to pay their fair share of taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "153. And the Government had provided a rebate to cushion the impact of the Property Tax changes this year. We will continue to closely monitor the property market, and will provide another rebate in 2025 if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "154. We recognise that there are retirees living in higher-end residential homes, who face cash flow issues when paying their Property Tax bills. To help them, IRAS will offer a 24-month instalment plan without any interest. They can apply for this via IRAS’ website or contact IRAS for more details.\n",

      "\n",
      "158. To recap, BEPS comprises two pillars:\n",
      "\n",
      "Pillar One aims to reallocate taxing rights on profits to market jurisdictions. When implemented, it will result in revenue losses for Singapore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pillar One has been delayed for now, and the implementation date remains unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pillar Two will introduce a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% for large MNE groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 74 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "Last Budget, | announced our intention to implement Pillar Two from 2025, and that we would monitor and adjust the timeline if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then, several jurisdictions have moved. The EU, the UK, Switzerland, Japan, and Korea are implementing Pillar Two rules from 2024. Others, like Hong Kong and Malaysia, have announced their plans to do so from 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "159. We will therefore move ahead with two components of Pillar Two, as planned.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. The first is the Income Inclusion Rule (or IIR). A jurisdiction that introduces this will subject the overseas profits of MNE groups parented in that jurisdiction to a minimum effective tax rate of 15%.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we will implement the IIR. In other words, MNE groups that are parented in Singapore will have to pay a\n",
      "\n",
      "minimum effective tax rate of 15% on their groups’\n",
      "\n",
      "overseas profits, regardless of where they operate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 75 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "c.\n",
      "\n",
      "| The second component is the Domestic Top-up Tax (or the DTT). This applies to the Singapore profits of MNE groups operating here. Without this tax, these MNE groups would have had to pay their parent jurisdictions the effective tax rate of 15% on their Singapore profits. Therefore, it is in our interest to implement the DTT, so that we collect the tax, rather than have it go somewhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "d. ThellIR and the DTT will take effect for businesses’ financial years starting on or after 1 January 2025, and will apply to large MNE groups with global revenue of at least 750 million euros annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "160. There is another component of Pillar Two: the Undertaxed Profits Rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. This is effectively a backstop, as it will allow Singapore to collect a share of the top-up tax on any MNE with operations here, if any portion of its income overseas has not been subject to the minimum tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. We will consider this at a later stage. Because with the DTT and IIR, we are already making major changes to our\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 76 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "corporate tax regime. So we will focus on implementing these changes first, and ensure a smooth rollout for the affected companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "161. In the short term, the implementation of Pillar Two will provide additional revenues. But it is uncertain how much this will be or how long it will last. We may even see a reduction in our tax base, should MNEs shift some of their activities to other jurisdictions in response to the new business environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "162. In any case, whatever additional revenues we obtain from Pillar Two will need to be reinvested for Singapore to stay competitive ina post-BEPS world.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. MNEs are now re-evaluating their plans and strategies. Other governments are also enhancing and refreshing their investment promotion toolkits.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. — That is why we are introducing the Refundable Investment Credit, which | mentioned earlier. We will also have to spend more to support new investments, research and innovation activities, and sustain our economic competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 77 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, given the significant spending required to stay competitive, at this point, | do not expect the new moves to generate net revenue gains for Singapore ona sustained basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "163. | will also make some further tax adjustments, to ensure our tax system remains fair and competitive. And details of the tax changes are in the Annex to the Budget. (See Annex H-1.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Medium-Term Outlook\n",
      "\n",
      "164. Sir, last year, the Ministry of Finance released a set of projections of our medium-term fiscal outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. These showed that Government spending has been rising steadily over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our spending in the late 2000s was around 15% of GDP. And over the span of ten years, it has grown by 3 percentage points of GDP, to around 18% of GDP.\n",
      "\n",
      "We expect spending to continue rising in this decade. Healthcare is one key driver for the increase. But there additional spending needs fuelling the increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 78 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "are\n",
      "\n",
      "d. Wewill have to spend more for the major moves to decarbonise our economy, as | explained earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "e. As part of Forward Singapore, we are making significant policy shifts to strengthen our social safety nets, and provide more assurance to Singaporeans. | have just introduced some of these measures in this year’s Budget. We will spend around $5 billion on Forward Singapore policy moves in FY2024, and close to $40 billion in total by the end of this decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "165. In our projections, MOF had assessed that Government spending will increase to around 20% of GDP by 2030. For now, that remains our assessment. Assuming we stay within this range of spending increase, we should have sufficient revenues to maintain a balanced budget over the coming years.\n",
      "\n",
      "166. But the medium-term fiscal position is tight. Because there are so many pressures for us to spend more, be it on healthcare, social needs, or the energy transition, and these are all big-ticket items. We will have to manage these expenditures carefully, or we will end up with a significant funding gap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page 79 of 86\n",
      "\n",
      "167. We can already see this happening in many other advanced economies where public finances are on an unsustainable path, and fiscal systems are at risk of breaking. We must never allow this to happen in Singapore. Instead, let us uphold the ethos of fiscal discipline and responsibility that has served us well, and ensure that our fiscal position always remains balanced, sound, and sustainable.\n",

      "\n",
      "169. For FY2023, our revenue collections were better than expected. And this was mainly due to higher Corporate Income Tax collections.\n",
      "\n",
      "170. The additional revenue will allow us to pay for new spending, including the $7.5 billion injection to the Majulah Package Fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "171. Accounting for both our revenue upside and higher spending, we expect to end FY2023 with a deficit of $3.6 billion, or 0.5% of GDP.\n",
      "\n",
      "172. For FY2024, we are budgeting a small surplus of $0.8 billion, or 0.1% of GDP, which is essentially a balanced fiscal position. The overall stance is appropriate, as we are providing targeted support\n",

I beg to move that Parliament approve the financial policy of the Government for the financial year 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025.\\n2. Sir, the past year has not been easy.\\na. The international environment was troubled.\\nb. The global economy was subdued.\\nc. Our own economy grew by a modest 1.1%, avoiding a recession.\\n3. I know that many households are feeling the pressure of higher living costs.\\na. Fortunately, we had some unexpected revenue upside from our strong economic rebound in the preceding two years.\\nb. And this is why the Government was able to enhance its assistance measures to relieve the burden on households.\\n4. For 2024, the outlook is mixed.\\na. Growth in the major economies on the whole is expected to remain resilient.\\nb. But geopolitical risks continue to loom large.\\nc. Wars are raging in Europe and the Middle East.\\nd. These conflicts can escalate dangerously, leading to disruptions in global energy markets and supply chains.\\n5. Fortunately, there are some upsides.\\na. Global inflationary pressures are expected to recede further. This may provide room for the major central banks to adopt more accommodative stances, which can help to ease financial conditions and support demand.\\nb. The global electronics industry is expected to recover. This will bolster the growth of many regional economies, including our key trading partners.\\nc. Meanwhile, Asia continues to be a key driver of global growth, with a wider spread of opportunities across the region - not just in China, but also in India and many parts of Southeast Asia.\\n6. Overall, we are cautiously optimistic that 2024 will be a better year. Besides lower inflation, we expect higher GDP growth at 1.0% to 3.0%.\\n7. But there is considerable uncertainty in the outlook and the risks are tilted to the downside.\\na. The international environment has darkened dramatically.\\nb. The post-Cold War era that began in the early 90s and fostered three decades of peace and stability is over.\\nc. We are now in a new era of conflict and confrontation, and there is no turning back.\\n\\nA. Introduction\\nd. What can we expect in this new world?\\ne. It will be more violent. We already see a growing zone of impunity involving armed conflict and terrorism that cannot be easily resolved by the global community.\\nf. It will be more fragmented. Because the major powers are prioritising national security over economic interdependence, and the traditional modes of cooperation are breaking down.\\ng. It will be messier and more unpredictable. Because there will be diminished willingness and capacity to tackle global issues, be it responding to future pandemics or tackling climate change.\\n8. These are the stark realities before us. For some time to come, Singapore will have to operate in an external environment that will be less stable and favourable to our security and prosperity than the preceding three decades.\\n9. That is why we embarked on the Forward Singapore exercise to refresh our social compact to keep our society strong and united,\\nand to set out a roadmap for our way forward in this very troubled world.\\na. Through Forward Singapore, we aim to give more assurance to help Singaporeans navigate the uncertainties in today's world; strengthen our sense of cohesion and solidarity; and keep our society together.\\nb. For as one united people, we can overcome all odds.\\nc. We can turn every challenge into opportunity, and every vulnerability into strength.\\nd. We can build a nation that is vibrant and inclusive, fair and thriving, resilient and united.\\n10. We have an ambitious agenda to achieve these shared goals.\\na. We have major plans to unfold over the coming years.\\nb. Some are ready to be implemented now.\\nc. Others will require more time to study or to work out the implementation details.\\nd. In this Budget, we will roll out the first instalment of our Forward Singapore programmes.\\n11. Budget 2024 is therefore about taking concrete steps to build our shared future together. We will:\\na. Tackle immediate challenges for households and businesses;\\nb. Pursue better jobs, better growth, and equip our workers for life;\\nc. Create more paths for equality and mobility;\\nd. Provide more assurance for families and seniors;\\ne. And ultimately forge a stronger and more united nation.\\n12. And I will touch on each of these in turn in the rest of my speech.\\n\\nB. Tackling Immediate Challenges\\n13. Sir, we have enjoyed low inflation in Singapore for more than a decade. But inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, which led to significant increases in global energy and food prices.\\n14. Despite the unprecedented surge in prices, we had good economic growth in 2022. So incomes that year rose faster than inflation and Singaporeans were better off, in real terms.\\n15. Unfortunately, this did not happen last year. Inflation had in fact started to moderate. But economic growth also slowed. As a result, real incomes declined.\\n16. We had picked up early indicators of this negative trend. And that is why I introduced the Cost-of-Living Support Package in September last year, and enhanced the Assurance Package to over $10 billion.\\n17. While we expect the situation to improve this year, there are uncertainties in the outlook as I mentioned just now. So in this Budget, I will do more to support households and further enhance the Assurance Package .\\na. First , I will provide an additional $600 in CDC Vouchers for all Singaporean households . The first $300 will be disbursed in end-June this year. The remaining $300 will be disbursed in January next year.\\nb. Second , I will provide a Cost-of-Living Special Payment of between $200 and $400 in cash. This will be extended to adult Singaporeans with Assessable Income of up to $100,000, and who do not own more than one property.\\nc. Third , I will provide additional one-off U-Save rebates to help households cope with increases in their utility bills . In total, eligible HDB households can expect to receive two-and-a-half times the amount of regular U-Save rebates, or up to $950, in FY2024. This will cover about four months of utility bills for those living in 3- and 4room flats.\\nd. Fourth , I will provide an additional one-off Service and Conservancy Charges (or S&CC) Rebate for HDB flats . Together with the regular S&CC rebates, eligible HDB households will receive up to four months of such rebates in FY2024.\\n\\nB. Tackling Immediate Challenges\\ne. Altogether, the additional support under the Assurance Package will cost $1.9 billion. (See Annex B-1 for details of the enhanced Assurance Package.)\\n18. We have designed this Package so that lower-income families get more support. We have also ensured that larger households, particularly those with seniors and children, get more support.\\n19. Let me give some illustrations:\\na. A lower-income household of four, with two young children, will receive about $5,500 in benefits in FY2024. This comprises cash, MediSave top-ups, U-Save and S&CC rebates, and CDC Vouchers.\\nb. A middle-income household of four, with two young children, will receive about $3,000 in benefits.\\nc. A middle-income household with six persons - a larger family - including two seniors and two young children, will receive about $8,000 in benefits.\\n20. Sir, these are concrete ways to help Singaporeans tackle cost-ofliving pressures. Let me assure everyone: we will always have your backs.\\n21. Beyond the Assurance Package, I will top up the GST Voucher Fund by $6 billion. This delivers on our commitment to permanently defray GST expenses for lower- and middle-income households, through the GST Voucher scheme.\\n22. Businesses also need help to manage rising costs. Many companies have seen increases in their wage bills, rental, and utilities, amongst others. I will therefore introduce an Enterprise Support Package , which will provide $1.3 billion in support to companies.\\na. First , companies will receive a 50% Corporate Income Tax Rebate capped at $40,000 , , in the Year of Assessment 2024. Not all companies are profitable, and some may not benefit from such a rebate. So I will provide a minimum benefit of $2,000 in cash payouts for companies that employed at least one local employee in 2023.\\nb. Second, I will enhance the Enterprise Financing Scheme , which helps Singapore enterprises with their financing\\nneeds. The maximum working capital loan quantum will be permanently raised to $500,000. I will also extend until 31 March 2025 the enhanced maximum trade loan quantum, as well as the Government's risk sharing of project loans to support domestic construction projects.\\n\\nB. Tackling Immediate Challenges\\nc. Third , I will extend the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit by a year to 30 June 2025. The Credit provides additional support for eligible employers to cover their out-of-pocket expenses when they embark on workforce and business transformation. With this extension, employers will have another year to claim any unused credit.\\nd. The measures in this Enterprise Support Package are tilted towards firms that make the effort to restructure and transform. I encourage all firms to make full use of these schemes, so that they can thrive and succeed, amidst a more challenging operating environment. (See Annex B-2 for details of Enterprise Support Package.)\\n23. The enhanced Assurance Package and the Enterprise Support Package will provide some near-term relief to Singaporean households and firms. These are needed during this period when inflation, while moderating, remains on the high side. But they are\\nnot permanent solutions. In the longer term, the best way to deal with inflation is to ensure that our firms and workers are more productive, and that real incomes continue to rise sustainably.\\n\\nC. Pursuing Better Growth and Jobs\\n24. Our key priority therefore is to ensure a strong, innovative, and vibrant economy. This is absolutely essential to secure good jobs and better lives for all Singaporeans, and on a sustained basis.\\n25. Since our early days of independence, we have been able to defy the odds and consistently achieve good economic performance. But we cannot afford to be complacent, especially in a more complex and volatile external environment.\\n26. In past years, some had suggested that Singapore should slow down; don't have to grow so quickly. Indeed, this was what happened last year - our economy grew by just about 1%. But if we were to experience similarly slow growth for several years in a row, we will be in trouble. We will have no chance of improving our collective well-being. Singaporeans' living standards will be dented. We will not be able to afford the social services we need. And in the end, lower-income workers and families will be hit the hardest.\\n27. We therefore make no apology for pursuing growth. To be clear, we are not going for growth at all costs. There is a limit to how fast we can grow due to the tighter constraints we face in land, labour, and carbon. But by focusing on productivity and innovation, we can\\npush the frontier and grow at an average of about 2% to 3% each year over the next decade.\\n- 28. Now, this is an ambitious goal given our stage of economic development. But we must aim high, so that Singapore keeps moving forward, and our people continue to enjoy more opportunities and a better quality of life.\\n\\nAnchoring Quality Investments\\n29. A crucial enabler for growth is our ability to attract high-quality and high-value investments to Singapore, because such projects bring the latest know-how and capabilities, and create good jobs for Singaporeans.\\n30. So far, our investment pipeline has been healthy. Despite a challenging external environment last year, EDB exceeded its targets, and brought in investments which are expected to create over 20,000 new jobs.\\n31. But the competition for investments is getting tougher.\\na. Governments around the world are rolling out vast subsidies to attract investments, especially in strategic\\nindustries. For example, in November last year, Japan announced that it would allocate 2 trillion yen, or about $18 billion, to support its semiconductor industry.\\nb. We cannot afford to engage in a 'bidding war' with the major economies.\\nc. But neither should we stand still and just do nothing.\\n32. We will therefore enhance our investment promotion toolkit by introducing a new Refundable Investment Credit . (See Annex C-1.)\\na. This is a tax credit with a refundable cash feature. It will support high-value and substantive economic activities, including the setting up or expansion of manufacturing facilities; new innovation and R&D activities; as well as activities in support of the green transition.\\nb. Essentially, this new tax credit will help us stay competitive and attract investments from global companies with the right know-how, and create good jobs for Singaporeans.\\n- 33. To support this and other investment promotion efforts, I will top up the National Productivity Fund by $2 billion .\\n\\nBuilding on Our Strengths\\n34. Besides anchoring new investments, we must build on our existing strengths, and upgrade the sectors where we have competitive advantages.\\n35. These advantages did not come about by chance. They are the result of many decades of hard work to restructure and to upgrade our economy. We did not just keep costs competitive. We also enhanced our capabilities and moved up the value chain, so as to justify the higher premiums for operating out of Singapore. And we are pressing on with these restructuring efforts through the Industry Transformation Maps.\\n36. Take semiconductors as one example. Singapore is not the cheapest location worldwide. But we have many things going for us our excellent connectivity, our reliability and stable business environment, and also a critical mass of leading companies based here. And they operate across the value chain, from design, to wafer fabrication, to assembly and testing. The companies here do not produce cutting-edge 3 nm chips, which you will read about in the\\nmedia these days. But they have carved out a niche in other types of chips, like specialty chips and NAND flash memory chips. These are critical enablers of automation, 5G, electric vehicles, and they are in high demand. And that is how this little red dot can be a key node in the semiconductor supply chain - we account on our own for more than 10% of the global semiconductor market, and 20% of semiconductor equipment in the world.\\n37. Likewise in finance, we are a leading centre in Asia, supporting businesses from all over the world. During this period of global uncertainty, we have been able to distinguish ourselves as a stable and trusted financial centre. The major financial institutions are keen to do more out of Singapore, and we are seeing a continued inflow of investments, capital, and talent.\\n38. So whether in advanced manufacturing or high-end services, the strengths we have today are not easily replicated by others. But the global competitive landscape is ever-changing and other countries, you can be sure, are seeking to overtake us. So in this Budget, I will set aside resources to reinforce our competitive lead.\\n39. I will top up the Financial Sector Development Fund by $2 billion . This will give MAS more resources to take full advantage of current opportunities, and extend our lead in the financial services\\n\\nBuilding on Our Strengths\\nsector - not just to do more in the core areas of banking, capital markets, asset management, and insurance, but also to build capabilities in new areas like FinTech, as well as green and transition finance.\\n40. I will set aside more funds for R&D - Research and Development - because this is how we push the frontiers of innovation across the entire economy.\\na. In 2020, we launched the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 (or RIE2025) plan, with a commitment of $25 billion.\\nb. I will invest a further $3 billion in RIE2025.\\nc. This will sustain our investments in research, innovation, and enterprise at about 1% of GDP. The additional resources will go towards research and related investments in national priorities such as advanced manufacturing, sustainability, the digital economy, and healthcare.\\nd. Our investments in R&D will take some time to translate into concrete outcomes. But we must take a long-term\\nview. For these investments help to develop a critical mass of capabilities, ideas, and talent. They enable us to sharpen our competitive edge globally, as a knowledgebased and innovation-driven economy.\\n41. Besides a steady commitment to R&D, we also need to harness the full power of technology across our key sectors.\\n42. One critical emerging technology is Artificial Intelligence. AI is not just about ChatGPT or Large Language Models. It is a generalpurpose technology, like electricity, the internal combustion engine, the computer, or the internet. It has the potential to transform a wide range of industries, and to enhance productivity across many existing processes, from drug discovery, to organising warehouses, or driving vehicles.\\n43. Singapore is already recognised as a serious player in AI development. We aim to go further - to build new peaks of excellence, and crowd in private sector investments. We have set out the plans to do so in the National AI Strategy 2.0 .\\n44. To support this strategy and further catalyse AI activities, I will invest more than $1 billion over the next five years into AI compute, talent, and industry development.\\n\\nBuilding on Our Strengths\\na. Part of the investment will be used to ensure that Singapore can secure access to the advanced chips that are so crucial to AI development and deployment.\\nb. We will also work with leading companies in Singapore and around the world to set up their AI Centres of Excellence here. We want these Centres to spur industry collaboration and innovation, and drive greater value creation across the whole economy.\\n45. In tandem, I will allocate additional resources to catalyse\\ninvestments in upgrading our Nationwide Broadband Network . With the additional investments, we aim to enable mass market access to broadband speeds of up to 10 Gigabits per second in the second half of this decade. This is 10 times faster than the broadband speed in most homes today. This also ensures that our connectivity infrastructure will be able to support technologies like AI and immersive media, as they become more pervasive in the future.\\n\\nDeveloping Our Local Enterprises\\n- 46. We will continue to do more to invest in and strengthen our local enterprises.\\na. We are helping smaller firms harness technology through pre-approved solutions, many tailored to the needs of specific industries. This enables the SMEs to 'plug and play' and quickly achieve greater efficiencies and productivity gains.\\nb. As companies grow, their needs will become more complex, especially as they go overseas. We are providing more customised support to help these companies scale up, and we will continue with these efforts.\\n47. One way for our companies to level up quickly is to partner with the multinational enterprises (or the MNEs) that are based here. The MNEs set high requirements and standards for firms that wish to partner or supply to them. We cannot force MNEs to choose only local suppliers. But we can and we will help Singapore enterprises to meet the high standards, and to form win-win partnerships with MNEs.\\na. Let me share an example from the aerospace industry. Aerospace parts must meet stringent manufacturing and safety requirements. So aerospace manufacturers like\\nRolls-Royce are highly selective in who they choose as partners.\\nb. Zincode, a local company, was supported by the Smart Manufacturing Joint Lab. This is a collaboration between A*STAR, Rolls-Royce, and Singapore Aero Engine Services Private Limited. The company was supported by the Lab to improve its image processing capabilities. As a result, it qualified as one of the approved partners for inspection work at the Rolls-Royce manufacturing facility here in Singapore. Zincode has now successfully captured new opportunities from other companies in the aerospace sector, and benefited from an increase in sales.\\n48. We want to help more companies like Zincode raise their capabilities and win new opportunities. Today, we have the Partnerships for Capability Transformation (or PACT) scheme. This supports collaborations between larger companies and SMEs, in the areas of supplier development and co-innovation.\\na. I will enhance PACT to support partnerships in more areas - including capability training, internationalisation, and corporate venturing.\\n\\nDeveloping Our Local Enterprises\\nb. With the enhanced PACT, we aim to help more of our local firms plug into global supply chains, compete in markets abroad, and grow to become industry leaders in their own right.\\n49. For firms to be competitive, they also need to embrace sustainability. SMEs today sometimes still treat sustainability as an additional imposition and cost. But going green can be a competitive advantage. Because the MNEs are already looking to reduce their carbon footprint, and they expect their suppliers to do the same. In other words, to play in the MNE value chain, our own companies must be 'sustainability-ready'.\\n50. I will therefore extend the enhanced support for green loans under the Enterprise Financing Scheme , and expand its scope to help more of our SMEs adopt green solutions.\\n51. I will also enhance the Energy Efficiency Grant . This was introduced in 2022 for companies in the Food Services, Food Manufacturing, and Retail sectors. I will extend the grant to more sectors including Manufacturing, Construction, Maritime, and Data Centres and their users . Beyond pre-approved energy-efficient solutions supported under the Grant, we will provide additional\\nsupport for companies with more ambitious plans to reduce their emissions. (See Annex C-2.)\\n52. The Minister for Trade and Industry will elaborate on this and other sustainability-related measures at the Committee of Supply.\\n53. We are taking concrete steps to keep our economy competitive and vibrant, and to help our enterprises seize new opportunities. We will do whatever it takes to secure our place as one of the leading economic hubs in the world, known for our innovation, dynamism, and deep capabilities, with good jobs and opportunities for our people.\\n\\nD. Equipping Our Workers for Life\\n54. Sir, people and talent are critical to our economic dynamism. We are investing heavily in our human capital, including in preschool and education. But learning cannot stop when formal schooling ends, and that is why we launched SkillsFuture - to systematically support Singaporeans in reskilling and upskilling, and to equip them throughout life.\\n55. The Singapore workforce today ranks highly in terms of skills and technical proficiency. Our workers are able to command a premium in the global marketplace because of their expertise. But with rapid technological advances, expertise is in constant flux. Jobs like data entry clerks and door-to-door salesmen have dwindled in numbers. New jobs that did not exist decades ago, like data scientists and digital marketers are now in demand.\\n56. Expertise keeps on changing. In other words, robots and machines will not completely replace humans at work. But they do change the way expertise is defined and how value is created. We therefore have to invest even more in our human capital, and help our workers refresh and update their skills, and learn how to harness new technologies more effectively. Indeed, this is something that\\nNTUC and the Labour Movement have consistently championed, most recently in the Forward Singapore engagements.\\n\\nStrengthening SkillsFuture\\n57. We started SkillsFuture nearly 10 years ago. Since then, Government spending on Continuing Education and Training has nearly doubled to $0.9 billion last year.\\n58. Today, every Singaporean gets a $500 SkillsFuture Credit, and all employers get support to train their workers. We have also built up a wide array of training options, which individuals enjoy generous subsidies for.\\n59. We have made good progress over the past decade. But there is still much more to be done. Continuous skills upgrading throughout life is now more than important than ever. So we must firmly establish SkillsFuture as a key pillar in our social compact.\\n60. Quality learning and skills training is not just about attending a one- or two-day course. Workers may need weeks or even months of training to get a proper skills reboot, especially if they are looking to move to a different area of work. Even if they stay in the same\\nindustry, they will need a substantial injection of skills from time to time to stay relevant.\\n61. But we know that taking time off from work to attend training courses over an extended period is not easy, especially for those in their 40s and 50s with financial and caregiving obligations.\\n62. I will therefore introduce a new SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme to better support our mid-career workers. I will share the broad thrusts of this programme, and the Minister for Education will provide more details at the Committee of Supply. (See Annex D-1.)\\n63. First , I will give all Singaporeans aged 40 and above a top-up in SkillsFuture Credit of $4,000.\\na. All Singaporeans aged 40 and above will get the top-up in May this year. For those who are younger, you do not have to worry. Your turn will come - you will get the top-up, when you turn 40.\\nb. We have deliberately allowed the existing basic tier of $500 in SkillsFuture Credit to be used for a wide range of courses, and this was to instil a habit of lifelong learning.\\n\\nStrengthening SkillsFuture\\nc. The new credit - this $4,000 credit - will be more targeted in scope. We will confine its usage to selected training programmes with better employability outcomes. This includes part-time and full-time diploma, post-diploma, undergraduate programmes, as well as courses for the Progressive Wage Model sectors. And that is because we want participants taking up these programmes to be assured of better employment outcomes after they have completed their training.\\n64. Second , to provide more reskilling options, I will provide subsidies to all Singaporeans aged 40 and above to pursue another full-time diploma at our Polytechnics, ITE, and Arts Institutions from Academic Year 2025 onwards.\\n65. In other words, we will give every Singaporean another bite of the education subsidy. Even after you have graduated from an Institute of Higher Learning as a younger person, you can come back again after you turn 40 to do a full-time diploma, and it will be at subsidised rates.\\n66. Third , I will provide a monthly training allowance to Singaporeans aged 40 and above who enrol in selected full-time courses.\\na. This training allowance will be equivalent to 50% of one's average income over the latest available 12-month period, and will be capped at $3,000 per month. Every individual can receive up to 24 months of such a training allowance throughout their lifetime.\\nb. This will support the full duration of a SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme, and more than half the duration of most qualifications issued by our Institutes of Higher Learning.\\n67. What do these changes mean for our workers?\\na. Take the example of Mr Calvin Li, 40 years old now; graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in Electronic, Computer and Communication Engineering.\\nb. He works today as a Project Director at Khoon Engineering, a mechanical and electrical service provider. With the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme, he will enjoy a $4,000 top-up in SkillsFuture Credit.\\n\\nStrengthening SkillsFuture\\nc. He can use the Credit to pursue a second diploma. This diploma will be offered at subsidised fees, and the Credit will cover more than half of the expense after subsidies.\\nd. Should he intend to do this full-time, he can receive the monthly training allowance of up to 50% of his previous pay for two years.\\n68. Sir, we are making a significant enhancement to our SkillsFuture ecosystem. But we will reap the full benefits only if all of us government, employers, workers, and unions - lean forward to truly deepen this culture of lifelong learning and skills mastery. This must be our shared commitment to one another - to help our fellow Singaporeans develop to their fullest potential, and to have productive and meaningful careers.\\n\\nSupporting the Involuntarily Unemployed\\n- 69. There is one other move we will make under SkillsFuture. We know that technological changes will bring about more churn in the economy. Even when the economy as a whole is doing well, some businesses or even some industries may be suffering. In fact, it is not possible to have an economy that is dynamic and growing without\\nfailures and losses. In some sectors, firms will have to let go of people, while in other sectors, new and better jobs will be created.\\n70. We have to accept this reality. But it doesn't mean we should be indifferent to the suffering caused when firms lay off their workers.\\n71. Losing a job is a major setback for workers and their families. Those who become involuntarily unemployed naturally feel the pressure to rush into the first available job they find. But the new job may not always be a good fit. Ideally, they should consider ways to upgrade their skills, and to find a job that fits their aptitude and talent. Displaced workers may not have the time to train or search for new jobs, especially when they are already straining to make ends meet.\\n72. Therefore, we will do more to support this group of workers. In particular, we will introduce a temporary financial support scheme for the involuntarily unemployed, while they undergo training or look for better-fitting jobs.\\na. We have to design this scheme carefully, including the quantum of support and the conditionalities that come with the support. This is to avoid the pitfalls that other\\ncountries experienced when they introduced unemployment benefits.\\nb. We are working out the parameters for the scheme, and we will provide more details later this year.\\n73. Ours must always be an economy that provides opportunities for all; an economy that benefits the many rather than the few. This is why we are making significant enhancements to SkillsFuture, and supporting jobseekers while they search for their next opportunity. We believe that every worker matters; that every citizen counts. We will equip every Singaporean to benefit from the fruits of our economic growth.\\n\\nE. Creating More Paths Towards Equality and Mobility\\n74. In many developed countries, rising inequality and slowing mobility have fractured cohesion, and deeply divided their peoples. These can create similar pressures here.\\n75. Indeed, we embarked on the Forward Singapore exercise because we do not want to succumb to the kind of harsh inequality we see in so many parts of the world. By creating more paths towards equality and mobility, we also put ourselves in a better position for continued growth - in other words, a strong economy and a strong society reinforce each other.\\n76. But tackling inequality is often easier said than done. Ideas on how to do so are frequently replete with unintended consequences. Simple handouts and blunt measures do not solve poverty. This is why Singapore has continually paved our own way since the beginning. We carefully study the experiences of others. We take note of where they have succeeded and failed. We introduce significant innovations that work for us, our ethos, our society. This is the Singapore way.\\nReducing Wage Gaps\\n77. Over the last decade, we have made progress in uplifting lowerwage workers, and reducing disparities in wages. Our income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, has declined to its lowest level over two decades.\\n78. Workfare and Progressive Wages are our key strategies to uplift our lower-wage workers. These strategies are working. I will make several adjustments to ensure they continue to deliver results. (See Annex E-1.)\\n79. First, I will enhance the Workfare Income Supplement scheme from next year.\\na. I will raise the qualifying income cap from $2,500 to $3,000 . This ensures that we continue to cover lowerwage workers, even as their wages grow.\\nb. I will also raise Workfare payouts. Lower-wage senior workers will qualify for a maximum annual payout of $4,900, from $4,200 today.\\n80. Second , I will raise the Local Qualifying Salary (or the LQS). All local employees at companies that hire foreign workers must be paid at least the LQS.\\n\\nE. Creating More Paths Towards Equality and Mobility\\na. The LQS for full-time workers will be raised from $1,400 to $1,600 from this year. The minimum hourly rate will be increased from $9 to $10.50 per hour.\\nb. This increase ensures we keep pace with wage growth.\\n81. Third, I will provide more support for employers who raise the wages of their lower-wage workers.\\na. In 2022, I introduced the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (or the PWCS), where the Government co-funds the wage increase of lower-wage workers with employers.\\nb. I know employers are concerned with rising business costs in today's economy. And so the Government will do its part to help. I will raise the co-funding levels for this year, from a maximum of 30%, to a maximum of 50%.\\nc. I will also raise the PWCS wage ceiling from $2,500 to $3,000 in 2025, in tandem with the increase in the qualifying income cap for Workfare.\\nd. And to provide for these enhancements, I will top up the PWCS Fund by $1 billion .\\n82. Besides uplifting lower-wage workers, we also want to improve wages across different professions. There will always be differences in wages in any society. But too large a gap creates unhealthy levels of anxiety and stress. Parents and children may get caught up in an education arms race, or may feel pressured to prioritise careers only in a few traditional fields, instead of focusing on their individual strengths and talents.\\n83. In fact, the vast majority of Singaporeans in the Forward Singapore engagements welcome broader definitions of success. We want more diverse pathways so that every individual can strive to be the best possible version of themselves. This also means we must accord greater value to those who are skilled in technical hands-on abilities, as well as those with the social and empathetic traits to excel in service jobs. In particular, the wages and career prospects of our ITE graduates should not be too far below their Polytechnic- and University-going peers.\\n84. I recently met some recent ITE graduates. I was inspired by their personal stories, and their enthusiasm to deepen the skills they have acquired at ITE.\\n\\nE. Creating More Paths Towards Equality and Mobility\\n85. One of them, Matthew Francis Thanarajoo, graduated from ITE in 2021 with a Higher Nitec in Mechatronics.\\na. He is now pursuing a Diploma in Mechatronics at Temasek Polytechnic, and honing his skills in automation and robotics.\\nb. These experiences have equipped him with confidence to pursue his aspirations in engineering. He will be representing Singapore at the WorldSkills competition later this year in France, and we wish him the very best.\\n86. We want to encourage and support more young ITE graduates in their upskilling efforts, so they can excel in a profession they have trained in, and get themselves onto a better career and wage trajectory. I will therefore provide more support for ITE graduates aged 30 and below through a new ITE Progression Award.\\n87. There are two parts to the Award:\\na. First , I will provide a $5,000 top-up to the Post-Secondary Education Accounts of ITE graduates when they enrol in a\\ndiploma programme. This will help to offset the costs of obtaining a diploma.\\nb. Second , when these students attain their diplomas, I will provide a further $10,000 top-up to their CPF Ordinary Accounts. This will give them a head-start in purchasing a home or saving for retirement.\\nc. Sir, this new Award is a significant investment in our ITE graduates. It represents our continuing commitment to uplift them, and to better equip them in their journey of lifelong learning.\\n\\nAdvancing Social Mobility\\n88. Besides tackling inequality, we must also uphold social mobility. And up to now, Singapore has fared better than other advanced economies. But we must continue to pay special attention to children from less well-off families, to ensure they have access to full and fair opportunities early in life.\\n89. Many of these families are already taking steps to build better lives for themselves, but they may find it hard to sustain progress.\\nWe know that they often face complex challenges, such as marital stress, existing debts, or even motivation or self-confidence issues.\\n90. Under the enhanced ComLink (or ComLink+), we are providing more customised support for these families. We are getting family coaches and volunteer befrienders to work directly with these families. They will jointly develop action plans to improve their life circumstances, and the coaches will provide additional support to the families, so as to encourage and motivate them towards their goals.\\na. The additional support will be rolled out in the form of ComLink+ Progress Packages . And this is yet another major innovation in our social policy landscape. (See Annex E-2.)\\nb. For example, adults in the family can each receive payouts of up to $600 every quarter, through a combination of cash and CPF, if they secure a job and stay employed.\\nc. Those who make voluntary contributions to their CPF will receive matching grants from the Government to grow their savings faster. This, combined with existing schemes like the Fresh Start Housing Scheme, will help these families buy their own homes.\\nd. We will also partner with corporates and community groups to implement the ComLink+ Progress Packages. The donors can provide additional financial support to these families, and contribute in other ways, like befriending and mentoring, to help them get back on their feet again.\\n91. Sir, in this Budget, we are taking further steps to ensure that all Singaporeans have opportunities to take on work they find meaningful and fulfilling, build on their talents, give their best, and be rewarded fairly for it. This is how we keep the Singapore Dream alive and well for all our people.\\n92. The Government will do our part. But I want to emphasise that it is not just about the Government doing more. We also need our employers, community groups, as well as families and individuals themselves, to step up. Together, we can and we will build - a fairer, a more equal, and a more inclusive Singapore.\\n\\nF. Providing More Assurance for Families and Seniors\\n- 93. Next, let me touch on our plans to build a Singapore made for families - an endearing home for all of us to sink roots, grow up, and grow old in.\\n\\nSupporting Families through Every Stage\\n94. Families are the bedrock of our society, and we will support their needs at every stage of life.\\n95. Let me start with support for our children, to give them a strong foundation in life.\\n96. We will continue to take steps to improve preschool affordability.\\na. At Government-supported preschools, we extend generous subsidies, so that out-of-pocket expenses are kept affordable.\\nb. We will lower the fees further so that full-day preschool expenses for dual-income families will be comparable to\\nthose of primary school and after-school student care.\\nc. We will do so in two stages. I will reduce monthly childcare fee caps in Government-supported preschools in 2025 , to $640 for Anchor Operators and $680 for Partner Operators. This is before the childcare subsidies which all families benefit from. I will make another move to reduce fee caps in 2026, and the details will be announced later.\\nd. I will also enhance existing preschool subsidies for lowerincome families. Currently, more subsidies are given to children with working mothers. I will extend these higher subsidies to all children from lower-income families, including those with non-working mothers. This will benefit up to 17,000 children.\\n97. In schools, we will do more to help our children develop the competencies and values they need to thrive in a more unpredictable future.\\na. MOE is placing more emphasis on competencies like adaptive and inventive thinking, communication skills, and civic literacy.\\nb. We want to encourage and recognise students who demonstrate such competencies, including by enhancing the Edusave awards.\\nc. I will therefore top up the Edusave Endowment Fund by $2 billion to support these and other education initiatives.\\n98. For young couples who are getting ready to settle down and form their own families, timely access to affordable housing is critical.\\na. We are helping first-timer families by ramping up BTO supply and giving them greater priority.\\nb. We are also making flats in choicer locations more affordable, and in a way that is fair and inclusive, through the 'Prime, Plus, and Standard' framework. This will be implemented later this year for new BTO projects.\\n99. Some couples have already booked their BTO flats, but they may like to have a place to stay temporarily, while they wait for the completion of their flats. And this is especially the case for those with young children.\\n\\nSupporting Families through Every Stage\\na. Currently, HDB offers subsidised rental housing under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (or the PPHS).\\nb. HDB receives many such applications for the scheme, and is ramping up supply to meet the demand. But in the interim, we want to do more to support such young families with urgent housing needs.\\nc. I will therefore provide a PPHS (Open Market) Voucher for one year , to support eligible families who rent a HDB flat in the open market.\\n100. In this Budget, I will also do more for families of persons with special needs or disabilities.\\n- a. We know that families of children with special needs face greater cost pressures due to higher fees at education and care services. Every student at a Special Education (or SPED) school already benefits from more subsidies than a primary school student in a mainstream school. But the fees at most SPED schools remain higher than those of mainstream schools due to the higher underlying costs.\\nb. We are studying further moves to alleviate the cost pressures on these families. As a first step, I will reduce the maximum monthly fees at SPED schools to $90 , down from $150 today. I will also lower the fee caps at all Special Student Care Centres to reduce the out-of-pocket expenses for families.\\nc. For adults with disabilities, I will provide more support for their employment and integration into the community. I will expand spaces in Sheltered Workshops and Day Activity Centres where they can undergo skills training, and launch more Enabling Services Hubs to provide community support to persons with disabilities and their caregivers.\\n101. The respective Ministers will share more on each of these moves at the Committee of Supply.\\n\\nStrengthening Retirement Adequacy\\n102. I will do more to support the retirement needs of our seniors.\\n103. And let me start with some adjustments to the CPF system (See Annex F-1.)\\n.\\n104. First , in line with the recommendations of the Tripartite Workgroup on Older Workers, we will continue with the next step of planned CPF contribution rate increases for senior workers. I will increase the CPF contribution rates for those aged 55 to 65 by a further 1.5 percentage points in 2025 .\\n105. I will also provide the CPF Transition Offset to employers for another year, to cover half of the increase in employer contributions for 2025. This will help to cushion the impact on business costs.\\n\\n106. Second , I will raise the Enhanced Retirement Sum .\\na. The ERS is the maximum amount that members can put into their CPF Retirement Accounts to receive CPF payouts.\\nb. I will increase the ERS from three times the Basic Retirement Sum, to four times, from 2025. This means the ERS next year will be $426,000. This will allow more members aged 55 and above to fully commit their accumulated CPF savings to receive higher CPF payouts, should they wish to do so.\\n107. Third , we will take steps to rationalise the CPF system .\\na. Today, members aged 55 and above have a Special Account and a Retirement Account.\\nb. From next year, we will close the SA - the Special Account - for those aged 55 and above. The SA savings will be transferred to the RA - the Retirement Account - up to the Full Retirement Sum, where they will continue to earn the long-term interest rate.\\nc. The remaining SA savings will be transferred to the Ordinary Account. Of course, members can voluntarily transfer their OA savings to the RA at any time, up to the revised ERS, to earn higher interest, and to receive higher retirement payouts.\\n108. I will also enhance the retirement support schemes for seniors who need more help.\\n- a. The Silver Support Scheme provides quarterly payments to seniors who had low incomes during their working years and have less family support. I will raise the qualifying per capita household income threshold for\\nSilver Support from $1,800 to $2,300, and increase the quarterly payments by 20%, to keep pace with inflation.\\n\\n106. Second , I will raise the Enhanced Retirement Sum .\\nb. The Matched Retirement Savings Scheme (or the MRSS) helps Singaporeans aged 55 to 70 with less CPF savings to save more, by providing dollar-for-dollar matching for cash top-ups to their CPF accounts. I will make several adjustments to the scheme.\\nc. I will extend the MRSS to those above the age of 70. This will enable more Singaporeans to meet their retirement needs, with the help of their families, employers, and the community.\\nd. I will increase the annual matching cap from $600 to $2,000, and set a lifetime matching cap of $20,000 .\\ne. Currently, we provide a tax relief to encourage Singaporeans to top up their CPF. But the matching grant is already a significant benefit extended by the Government. So we will remove the tax relief for the cash top-ups that attract the matching grant.\\nf. These changes to the Silver Support Scheme and the MRSS will take effect from 2025.\\n109. 'Young Seniors' who are currently in their 50s and early 60s will get an additional boost for their retirement through the Majulah Package . This was announced by Prime Minister Lee at last year's National Day Rally.\\n110. While the package is geared towards supporting Young Seniors, Pioneer and Merdeka Generation seniors will benefit too. In fact, all Singaporeans born in 1973 or earlier will receive at least one component of the Majulah Package. Let me explain. (See Annex F-2.)\\na. First , I will provide an Earn and Save Bonus , to help seniors earning up to $6,000 per month accumulate more retirement savings. They will receive a yearly bonus of up to $1,000 for as long as they work, with more going to those who earn lower incomes.\\nb. Second , I will provide a one-time Retirement Savings Bonus of between $1,000 and $1,500 to seniors with retirement savings below the Basic Retirement Sum.\\n\\n106. Second , I will raise the Enhanced Retirement Sum .\\nc. Both these bonuses will be for seniors who live in a property with Annual Value of $25,000 or less, and own no more than one property.\\nd. Third , I will provide a one-time MediSave Bonus to all seniors born in 1973 or earlier. Young Seniors with less means will be given the higher tier of $1,500; and all other seniors will receive $750.\\n111. The Minister for Manpower will share more details at the COS.\\n112. In all, the Majulah Package will benefit about 1.6 million Singaporeans, at a total lifetime cost of $8.2 billion. To honour this commitment without burdening future generations, I will set aside $7.5 billion in a new Fund - the Majulah Package Fund . And this will be sufficient to cover the lifetime cost of the Package, after accounting for investment income of the Fund.\\n\\nKeeping Healthcare Affordable and Accessible for All\\n- 113. Another significant undertaking is healthcare. Over the years, we have invested heavily to ensure healthcare remains affordable and accessible for all.\\na. MOH's annual budget has tripled within a decade.\\nb. And we have put the additional spending to good use. We are devoting more resources to areas of growing importance, like preventive health, support for our seniors, and mental health and well-being, as recently affirmed by this House. We also continue to enjoy improvements in health outcomes, with Singaporeans living longer and healthier lives.\\n114. But with a rapidly ageing population, the fiscal pressures of healthcare will only grow. As a responsible Government, we have to plan ahead and set aside sufficient resources to keep healthcare affordable for all.\\na. The GST increase was meant for this purpose.\\nb. Essentially, we are pre-funding the rising healthcare expenditure by increasing GST now, instead of waiting to do so in the future. Because if we wait, we will end up imposing a heavier burden on our future selves and our children.\\n115. Of course, individuals have a part to play too. That's why we launched Healthier SG to empower all Singaporeans to take charge of our own health. While it is still early days, the momentum is very encouraging. More than 700,000 Singapore residents have enrolled in Healthier SG.\\na. One of them is Mdm Rubiah, who turns 69 this year. She credits her Healthier SG consultation for timely advice on how best to manage her health. Today, she is monitoring her blood pressure daily, cutting down on ice cream and keropok in her diet, and staying active through exercise classes and nature walks. She has also helped to spread the word, by volunteering at a Healthier SG roadshow.\\nb. Sir, I urge all seniors to follow in the footsteps of Mdm Rubiah. Heed your doctor's advice, participate in programmes that help you stay healthy, and even pass it on by contributing as a senior volunteer.\\n116. Even with healthier lifestyles, all of us will still need some form of medical care as we get older, and especially nearer to the end of life. We must expect healthcare costs, including medical insurance premiums, to rise, even after generous Government subsidies.\\n\\nKeeping Healthcare Affordable and Accessible for All\\n117. We want to ensure that all Singaporeans, including the selfemployed and those who are not working, are able to build up their medical savings in anticipation of these rising costs. I will therefore provide all adult Singaporeans aged 21 to 50 a one-time MediSave Bonus of up to $300 .\\na. This will benefit about 1.4 million Singaporeans, and help them to cover their smaller medical bills and insurance premiums. (See Annex F-3.)\\nb. And coupled with the Majulah Package for older cohorts, we will collectively provide a MediSave Bonus for about 3 million Singaporeans this year.\\n118. To provide more support for healthcare costs, I will also update the per capita household income thresholds for our healthcare and associated social support subsidy schemes.\\na. Such schemes include the MediShield Life premium subsidies, the Community Health Assist Scheme (or CHAS) subsidies for primary care, and subsidies for outpatient and inpatient treatments at our public hospitals.\\nb. The changes to the per capita household income thresholds will mean additional Government spending in healthcare and other related areas of around $300 million per year. More than 1 million Singaporeans can expect to benefit from higher subsidies. This will provide greater assurance for healthcare costs, which will also reduce the financial pressures on caregivers. (See Annex F-4.)\\n119. Preventive care is especially important for seniors. Loneliness can do great harm to a senior. They need to stay active and socially connected. This is why we have Age Well SG - it is a new national programme to support seniors to age actively, stay socially connected, and be cared for within their own communities.\\n120. I will set aside $3.5 billion for Age Well SG initiatives over the next decade . And this includes several components.\\na. First , an expanded network of Active Ageing Centres, so that all seniors can look forward to a wider range of programmes at these centres, from physical exercises to volunteering opportunities.\\nb. Second, for seniors with care needs, we will develop more assisted living options, such as Community Care\\nApartments and better home care arrangements, to empower them to age confidently in their homes and community.\\n\\nKeeping Healthcare Affordable and Accessible for All\\nc. Third, 'silver upgrades' to our residential estates, to enable seniors to live more independently and safely in the community. And this will cover amenities like therapeutic gardens and barrier-free ramps, and seniorfriendly home fittings such as wider toilet entrances and shower seats.\\nd. Fourth , improvements to our commuter infrastructure for seniors' mobility and safety. This means more sheltered linkways, bus stops with senior-friendly features, as well as safer and more pedestrian-friendly roads.\\n121. Sir, when you combine of all these efforts, the suite of investments we are making - in education, housing, retirement, and healthcare - they speak to our steadfast commitment to address the needs of our families and seniors, through every stage of life. Through these investments, we will provide more assurance to all Singaporeans - to set minds at ease, improve lives and well-being, and ensure Singapore remains home truly for all of us.\\n\\nG. Forging a Stronger and More United Nation\\n- 122. Alongside our investments to strengthen our economy and society, we will also make the investments needed to forge a stronger and more united nation. We will safeguard what makes Singapore special and resilient - our commitment to take care of and defend one another, sustain the trust we have in each other and our institutions, and build our strong sense of national pride and identity.\\n\\nA Safe and Secure Singapore\\n123. Since independence, we have invested steadily to safeguard our peace and security.\\na. Over the last two decades, we have allocated around 3% to 4% of our GDP annually to MINDEF's budget.\\nb. At the same time, over the past decade, our spending on domestic security has doubled to more than $8 billion, or about 1.3% of our GDP.\\nc. We will continue to build and maintain a strong and effective SAF and Home Team. We will invest in them,\\nupgrade their capabilities year by year, to protect ourselves from potential aggressors and security threats.\\n124. The backbone of our defence and security remains National Service. We owe a huge debt to our national servicemen, who have served faithfully, and made immeasurable sacrifices for our peace and security.\\na. I will therefore provide $200 in the form of LifeSG credits to all past and present national servicemen, including those enlisting this year. (See Annex G-1.)\\nb. It is a small gesture, but when you add it all up, it will cost us $240 million and benefit 1.2 million national servicemen. I hope this will go some way in expressing our appreciation and gratitude to our national servicemen as well as their families for all that they have done, and will continue to do for our country.\\n125. In today's world, defence and security apply not just in the physical environment, but also in the digital domain. Scams, ransomware, data breaches, denial of service, and other cyber threats have become increasingly commonplace. The development and adoption of new technologies like AI and quantum computing\\nalso change the threat landscape. Cyberattacks will increase in speed, scale, and sophistication.\\n126. We have taken steps to strengthen our cyber defence. We established the Digital and Intelligence Service in the SAF. We will establish a new National Cybersecurity Command Centre at the Punggol Digital District to better coordinate cyber defence operations, improve collaboration with industry and academia, and spur innovation in cybersecurity. This will improve our capabilities to monitor, detect, and coordinate our defences against cyber threats.\\n\\nSafeguarding Energy Security Amidst the Energy Transition\\n- 127. Besides the conventional areas of security, we need to address an emerging security challenge - and that is energy, and more specifically the transition to cleaner energy.\\n128. In the near to medium term, natural gas, which currently generates almost all of our electricity, will remain critical.\\n- a. Our natural gas supplies come through pipelines from Malaysia and Indonesia, and in the form of liquefied natural gas (or LNG) from a range of sources.\\nb. We are now planning to build a second LNG terminal to meet our growing electricity needs.\\n129. Natural gas is the cleanest of all fossil fuels. But we will not be able to achieve net zero if we continue to rely solely on natural gas. Unfortunately, we do not have many options for clean energy - we have no tidal power, no wind power, and not enough land for mass deployment of solar. So, what do we do?\\na. One way is to import low-carbon electricity.\\nb. And we are making progress on this front.\\nc. But there is a limit to importing electricity without compromising security. So we will need other options to decarbonise the rest of our energy supply.\\n130. And that is why we are actively exploring other options.\\na. Hydrogen has the potential as a clean fuel. For now, it is still technologically nascent, costly, and risky. Nevertheless, we have set out a National Hydrogen Strategy to take purposeful steps forward. We will start by testing and deploying ammonia, which is a hydrogen\\ncarrier, for power generation and bunkering on Jurong Island.\\n\\nSafeguarding Energy Security Amidst the Energy Transition\\nb. We are also exploring other energy sources. We are actively studying the possibilities for geothermal power. After all, we do have a hot spring in Sembawang. But we will need very deep drilling to assess the potential, and it really remains to be seen if this will be viable.\\nc. Further out in the future, we do not rule out nuclear power. Nuclear technologies are advancing rapidly, with smaller, safer, and more fuel-efficient designs. We will build up our capabilities, so that we can critically assess the evolving technologies in this space and decide on the feasibility of nuclear deployment one day in the future.\\n131. There is considerable uncertainty as to how all these energy pathways will work out. What is clear, however, is that significant effort and costs will be needed to transit from a system powered almost entirely by natural gas to one powered largely by clean energy.\\na. We say this is an 'energy transition'. Transition is a rather innocuous word. But the scale of this so-called transition\\nis massive, and we will need to get it done over the next two decades or so, which is not a lot of time, when you think about the enormity of the task.\\nb. For example, to import low-carbon electricity, we will need to invest in submarine cables and upgrade our existing power grid. Or if we decide to scale up the use of hydrogen, we will need to put in place new infrastructure for generation, storage, and delivery. All of these investments will be costly. They cannot be done by the private sector alone, and will likely need some catalytic funding from the Government.\\nc. I will therefore set up a Future Energy Fund with an initial injection of $5 billion. This will give us the confidence to invest in good time, put us in a better position to move quickly on critical infrastructure, and enhance our security in clean energy.\\n\\nBuilding a United Nation\\n- 132. The resilience of our nation of course is not only measured by what we spend, or by our infrastructure and hardware. Rather, our true resilience lies within - in the strong bonds Singaporeans have\\nforged among ourselves and in our collective willingness to take care of one another. Every Singaporean man, woman, and child knows he or she belongs to this island nation, everyone has a place in our society, each has a role to play in our unfolding Singapore story. That is the essence of Total Defence, which we commemorated for the 40 th time yesterday.\\n133. We nurture these bonds between Singaporeans by strengthening our culture of giving.\\na. There are many who have done well in Singapore and they want to give back, but they may not know how or where to start.\\nb. We will do more to help these donors better appreciate the needs of our society and advise them on how to more effectively direct their resources - financial or nonfinancial - to support lower-income families. This effort will be led by the Community Foundation of Singapore, in partnership with MSF and the Community Chest.\\nc. In the same spirit, we want to encourage charities to work together to uplift each other and better meet the needs of their beneficiaries. I will do so by extending the Charities\\nCapability Fund Collaboration Grant for three years till end-FY2026 . This will support collaborative projects among charities to enhance their governance, efficiency, and capabilities.\\n134. Doing good also extends beyond our shores. Many Singaporeans readily step forward to support those affected by humanitarian crises overseas.\\na. We saw this in the relief efforts following the devasting earthquake in Türkiye and Syria last year; and also in the generous donations in response to the human tragedy arising from the Israel-Hamas conflict.\\nb. To encourage Singaporeans to support those in need overseas, I will introduce an Overseas Humanitarian Assistance Tax Deduction Scheme . This will provide 100% tax deductions for cash donations made towards overseas emergency humanitarian assistance causes through designated charities. This will run for four years as a pilot scheme. (See Annex G-2.)\\n135. A stronger culture of giving will bind us closer together, and make us a more caring and gracious society.\\n\\nBuilding a United Nation\\n136. Another way to strengthen our solidarity is through the common experiences we all partake in. And the arts and sports provide us with the platforms to do so.\\n137. Let me start with the arts. The arts help to express our unique Singaporean culture, strengthen our shared bonds, and make Singapore a distinctive home.\\na. The National Arts Council has refreshed Our SG Arts Plan to drive transformation efforts in the arts sector. We will support this plan by investing $100 million over the next four years.\\nb. As part of this plan, we aim to make the arts more accessible to all Singaporeans. We will unlock more opportunities and touchpoints for our artists to infuse the arts everywhere in our city, and in our communities.\\nc. The additional investments will also strengthen the foundation for a more vibrant arts industry. NAC will support arts groups to develop and showcase their diverse offerings as well as to strengthen our talent pool. Self-employed artists will also benefit from more\\ndevelopment opportunities to broaden and deepen their skills.\\n138. Apart from the arts, there are few endeavours that can rally the country and ignite the Singapore spirit like sports. From the grassroots to the global stage, from community participation to highperformance, sports bring Singaporeans from all walks of life together.\\n139. At the grassroots level, we will enable more Singaporeans to participate in sports by continuing to support the Sports Facilities Master Plan . With this, Singaporeans can look forward to new and rejuvenated sports centres in Toa Payoh, Punggol, and Clementi, as well as more sports and recreational facilities in our neighbourhoods.\\n140. Many Singaporeans want to support our national athletes, and we will provide them with more platforms to do so.\\n141. We will anchor more major sports events in Singapore, so that our athletes can compete in top-tier competitions against the world's best on home ground, and this will also allow more Singaporeans to cheer for Team Singapore.\\n\\nBuilding a United Nation\\n142. We now have the One Team Singapore Fund, which provides dollar-for-dollar matching for donations towards Team Singapore athletes.\\na. I will provide a $20 million top-up for the One Team Singapore Fund and extend it till end-FY2027 .\\nb. In addition, I will broaden the scope of donations eligible for matching to cover athletes in emerging sports, like pickleball, tchoukball, and powerlifting. I will also include SportCares, which provides opportunities for vulnerable children and youth, persons with disabilities, and seniors to participate in sporting programmes.\\n143. The Minister for Culture, Community, and Youth will share more about our arts and sports initiatives at the COS.\\n144. Sir, everywhere in the world, we see societies becoming increasingly divided, and nations becoming more and more fragile. Economic growth or social transfers alone cannot guarantee that we succeed.\\n145. This Budget therefore invests in our national resilience - from ensuring the effectiveness of our military and domestic security, to\\nsafeguarding our energy security and building a stronger national identity. These will shield us from external threats and the forces that threaten to pull us apart. Only then can we be confident that Singapore will endure.\\n\\nH. Securing Our Fiscal Position\\n146. Our ability to invest in our economy, our society, and our resilience has to be anchored on a strong fiscal position.\\n- 147. Fiscal responsibility has always been a key part of the Singapore DNA. We spend our resources wisely, and we take great care to provide for our children and grandchildren. This is why I made major revenue moves in the last two Budgets. These moves have put us on a stronger fiscal footing for the next decade, while ensuring that our overall system of public finances remains fair and progressive.\\n\\nTax Changes\\n148. This year, in light of concerns over cost of living, I will provide a Personal Income Tax Rebate of 50% for the Year of Assessment 2024.\\na. This will be capped at $200 so that the benefits go mostly to our middle-income workers.\\nb. The rebate will cost the Government $350 million.\\n149. Currently, taxpayers may claim a range of dependant-related reliefs, if their dependants have an annual income of $4,000 or less.\\nWe have received feedback from members of public, tax practitioners, as well as Labour MPs, to consider increasing the dependant income threshold in view of rising cost of living and wage levels. So with effect from the Year of Assessment 2025, I will increase the annual income threshold for dependant-related reliefs from $4,000 to $8,000.\\n150. In Budget 2022, I announced a two-step increase in Property Tax rates for residential properties. This was meant as a wealth tax, targeted at all investment properties, as well as the higher-end segment of owner-occupied properties.\\n- 151. Prior to that Budget announcement, market rents had been relatively flat for the preceding five years. But from 2022 onwards, market rents increased significantly due to the combination of strong demand and Covid-related supply constraints. As a result, the Annual Values (or the AVs) also increased sharply. We had originally expected the Property Tax changes to impact mainly the top 7% of owneroccupied residential properties. But the AV increases resulted in the proportion of affected owner-occupied properties nearly doubling to 13%.\\n152. In light of these market trends, I will raise all the AV bands of the owner-occupier residential Property Tax rates with effect from 1\\nJanuary 2025. Currently, Property Tax is charged on the bands of AV from $8,000 to over $100,000. I will raise the lower threshold from $8,000 to $12,000 and the highest band from over $100,000 to over $140,000, and corresponding adjustments will be made to the bands in between. This will still uphold the intent of the Property Tax changes, and ensure that those residing in higher-value properties continue to pay their fair share of taxes.\\n\\nTax Changes\\n153. And the Government had provided a rebate to cushion the impact of the Property Tax changes this year. We will continue to closely monitor the property market, and will provide another rebate in 2025 if needed.\\n154. We recognise that there are retirees living in higher-end residential homes, who face cash flow issues when paying their Property Tax bills. To help them, IRAS will offer a 24-month instalment plan without any interest. They can apply for this via IRAS' website or contact IRAS for more details.\\n155. Next, I will adjust the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (or the ABSD) for the purchase of residential properties.\\na. Today, married couples with an existing residential property can enjoy an ABSD refund on their replacement\\nprivate property under the ABSD concession for Singaporean married couples.\\n- b. To better support seniors who wish to right-size, I will extend the concession to single Singapore Citizens aged 55 and above . In other words, these seniors will be able to claim a refund of ABSD paid on their replacement private property, if they sell their first property within six months after purchasing a lower-value replacement private property. This extension will take effect from today.\\n156. I will also introduce some flexibility to the ABSD regime for housing developers.\\na. Housing developers are now granted an ABSD remission, provided they sell all the units in their development within a prescribed sale timeline.\\nb. But despite their best efforts, the developers sometimes face difficulties in meeting this timeline requirement. They are then subject to a full clawback of the ABSD.\\n- c. I will lower the ABSD clawback rate, should developers sell at least 90% of each development within the prescribed sale timeline . This ensures that housing supply continues to be released promptly, while providing some flexibility to the developers. The details of this change will be released in a statement later today.\\n\\nBEPS 2.0\\n157. Next: Corporate Income Tax - I will make significant adjustments to our tax system to take into consideration the international Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (or BEPS) 2.0 initiative.\\n158. To recap, BEPS comprises two pillars:\\na. Pillar One aims to reallocate taxing rights on profits to market jurisdictions. When implemented, it will result in revenue losses for Singapore.\\nb. Pillar One has been delayed for now, and the implementation date remains unclear.\\nc. Pillar Two will introduce a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% for large MNE groups.\\nd. Last Budget, I announced our intention to implement Pillar Two from 2025, and that we would monitor and adjust the timeline if needed.\\ne. Since then, several jurisdictions have moved. The EU, the UK, Switzerland, Japan, and Korea are implementing Pillar Two rules from 2024. Others, like Hong Kong and Malaysia, have announced their plans to do so from 2025.\\n159. We will therefore move ahead with two components of Pillar Two, as planned.\\na. The first is the Income Inclusion Rule (or IIR) . A jurisdiction that introduces this will subject the overseas profits of MNE groups parented in that jurisdiction to a minimum effective tax rate of 15%.\\nb. So we will implement the IIR. In other words, MNE groups that are parented in Singapore will have to pay a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on their groups' overseas profits, regardless of where they operate.\\nc. The second component is the Domestic Top-up Tax (or the DTT). This applies to the Singapore profits of MNE groups operating here. Without this tax, these MNE groups would have had to pay their parent jurisdictions the effective tax rate of 15% on their Singapore profits. Therefore, it is in our interest to implement the DTT, so that we collect the tax, rather than have it go somewhere else.\\nd. The IIR and the DTT will take effect for businesses' financial years starting on or after 1 January 2025, and will apply to large MNE groups with global revenue of at least 750 million euros annually.\\n160. There is another component of Pillar Two: the Undertaxed Profits Rule .\\n\\nBEPS 2.0\\na. This is effectively a backstop, as it will allow Singapore to collect a share of the top-up tax on any MNE with operations here, if any portion of its income overseas has not been subject to the minimum tax.\\nb. We will consider this at a later stage. Because with the DTT and IIR, we are already making major changes to our\\ncorporate tax regime. So we will focus on implementing these changes first, and ensure a smooth rollout for the affected companies.\\n161. In the short term, the implementation of Pillar Two will provide additional revenues. But it is uncertain how much this will be or how long it will last. We may even see a reduction in our tax base, should MNEs shift some of their activities to other jurisdictions in response to the new business environment.\\n162. In any case, whatever additional revenues we obtain from Pillar Two will need to be reinvested for Singapore to stay competitive in a post-BEPS world.\\na. MNEs are now re-evaluating their plans and strategies. Other governments are also enhancing and refreshing their investment promotion toolkits.\\nb. That is why we are introducing the Refundable Investment Credit, which I mentioned earlier. We will also have to spend more to support new investments, research and innovation activities, and sustain our economic competitiveness.\\nc. Overall, given the significant spending required to stay competitive, at this point, I do not expect the new moves to generate net revenue gains for Singapore on a sustained basis.\\n163. I will also make some further tax adjustments, to ensure our tax system remains fair and competitive. And details of the tax changes are in the Annex to the Budget. (See Annex H-1.)\\n\\nMedium-Term Outlook\\n164. Sir, last year, the Ministry of Finance released a set of projections of our medium-term fiscal outlook.\\na. These showed that Government spending has been rising steadily over the years.\\nb. Our spending in the late 2000s was around 15% of GDP. And over the span of ten years, it has grown by 3 percentage points of GDP, to around 18% of GDP.\\nc. We expect spending to continue rising in this decade. Healthcare is one key driver for the increase. But there are additional spending needs fuelling the increase.\\nd. We will have to spend more for the major moves to decarbonise our economy , as I explained earlier .\\ne. As part of Forward Singapore, we are making significant policy shifts to strengthen our social safety nets, and provide more assurance to Singaporeans. I have just introduced some of these measures in this year's Budget. We will spend around $5 billion on Forward Singapore policy moves in FY2024, and close to $40 billion in total by the end of this decade.\\n165. In our projections, MOF had assessed that Government spending will increase to around 20% of GDP by 2030. For now, that remains our assessment. Assuming we stay within this range of spending increase, we should have sufficient revenues to maintain a balanced budget over the coming years.\\n166. But the medium-term fiscal position is tight. Because there are so many pressures for us to spend more, be it on healthcare, social needs, or the energy transition, and these are all big-ticket items. We will have to manage these expenditures carefully, or we will end up with a significant funding gap.\\n- 167. We can already see this happening in many other advanced economies where public finances are on an unsustainable path, and fiscal systems are at risk of breaking. We must never allow this to happen in Singapore. Instead, let us uphold the ethos of fiscal discipline and responsibility that has served us well, and ensure that our fiscal position always remains balanced, sound, and sustainable.\\n\\nFY2023 and FY2024 Fiscal Position\\n168. Sir, let me now summarise our fiscal position for both FY2023 and FY2024.\\n169. For FY2023, our revenue collections were better than expected. And this was mainly due to higher Corporate Income Tax collections.\\n170. The additional revenue will allow us to pay for new spending, including the $7.5 billion injection to the Majulah Package Fund.\\n171. Accounting for both our revenue upside and higher spending, we expect to end FY2023 with a deficit of $3.6 billion, or 0.5% of GDP.\\n172. For FY2024, we are budgeting a small surplus of $0.8 billion, or 0.1% of GDP, which is essentially a balanced fiscal position. The overall stance is appropriate, as we are providing targeted support\\nfor households and businesses, even as the economy is projected to operate at around potential. (See Annex H-2.)\\n\\nI. Conclusion\\n173. Mr Speaker, let me conclude.\\n174. We are living in a world which will become more violent, more fragmented, and more unpredictable in the years to come.\\na. We wish this were not so.\\nb. We will try our best, working with others in the international community, to shape better global outcomes.\\nc. But we also have to be realistic. Great catastrophes often seem unthinkable until they happen. Things may well get worse before they get better. So let us be mentally prepared, and take steps now to adapt to this messy world.\\n175. This is not the first time that we've found ourselves in such a situation.\\na. Since our independence, we've had to adjust to all sorts of external disruptions and shocks.\\nb. The British deciding to withdraw troops from Singapore in 1967; the global oil crises in 1973 and 1979; the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997; the dot-com bust in the early 2000s; 9/11; SARS; the Global Financial Crisis of 2008; and of course, more recently the Covid-19 pandemic.\\nc. Each time, we were able to weather the storms, and emerge stronger.\\nd. I believe we can do so again in our road ahead - so long as we stay united, work together, and continue to keep faith in each other.\\n176. Budget 2024 is about acting on this belief. We are helping Singaporeans with their cost-of-living concerns. We are taking major steps to advance our Forward Singapore agenda.\\na. We will grow the economy. We must. For growth is the pre-requisite to create better jobs and raise living standards for all.\\nb. We will equip everyone to realise their full potential, and ensure that everyone benefits from our nation's progress.\\n\\nI. Conclusion\\nc. We will strengthen our system of risk pooling and social support, so that Singaporeans can be better assured through every life stage, and better equipped to bounce back from every setback.\\nd. We will fortify our resilience, solidarity, and unity, so that we remain strong and effective against any challenges or threats.\\n177. We are not the only country adapting to a different world. Countries everywhere are searching for solutions too. Many find it hard to implement bold and long-term plans.\\n178. But we can make it happen in Singapore.\\n179. We are able to do so because:\\na. Our fiscal position is healthy and sustainable.\\nb. Our Government has the trust of Singaporeans.\\nc. Our people are united, and our social compact is strong.\\n180. These are the critical ingredients behind the Singapore story.\\na. What we have today is rare, remarkable, and unique.\\nb. Let us cherish it, treasure it, and harness these strengths to remain a shining red dot in a troubled world.\\n181. During the dark days of Covid-19, which feels like a bad dream to all of us now, I remember visiting Riverside Secondary School. The teacher had asked the students to imagine what they would be doing in ten years' time, and to write a letter to their future selves.\\na. One student - Levin Ong - wrote, and I quote: 'Dear future Levin, I hope you have been well in these past ten years. I am grateful for how Singapore is dealing with Covid-19… the challenges I face are small compared to others during this difficult time. I want the world to be a better place and contribute back to society to the best of my ability. I hope, by 2030, I have made a better world for everyone.'\\nb. Hope for the future. Giving back to society. Each one of us doing our best to make this a better place for all.\\n182. Mr Speaker, let us draw inspiration from young Singaporeans like Levin, move forward with confidence, and build our shared future together.\\n183. Sir, I beg to move.\""
